A 60 yr old chronic smoker presents with painless gross hematuria of 1 day duration. Investigation of choice to know the cause of hematuria,,"Urine microscopy for malignant cytology ""Painless haematuria is by far the most common symptom of bladder cancer and should be regarded as indicative of a bladder carcinoma until proven otherwise."" Bailey & Love 25/e p1336 (24/e p1363) Cigarette smoking is the main etiological factor and accounts ,for about 50% of bladder cancers Among the given options 'urine microscopy' is the best choice for investigating a pt. with high suspicion for bladder ca. This is not a good screening test but a positive result is highly specific. The best investigation would be cystoscopy & biopsy. Investigations for bladder cancer 1. Urinary cytology - Exfoliated cells from both normal and neoplastic urothelium can be readily identified in voided urine. Examination of cytological specimens can detect the malignant cells either at the time of initial presentation or during follow-up. Cytological examination may be especially useful in screening high-risk population and assessing the response to treatment. 2. Cystourethroscopy and tumor resection - The diagnosis and initial staging of bladder cancer is made by cystoscopy and transurethral resection. 3.Imaging (IVP, CT, MRI) - Although various imaging techniques can detect bladder cancer, its presence is confirmed by cystoscopy & biopsy. - Therefore imaging modalities are used to image the upper urinary tract and, when infiltrating bladder tumors are detected to assess the depth of muscle wall infiltration and the presence of local & distant metastasis. - Intravenous urography remains one of the most common imaging tests for the evaluation of hematuria. However, intravenous pyelography is increasingly being replaced by computed tomography (CT) urography, which is more accurate, for evaluation of the entire abdominal cavity, renal parenchyma, and ureters in patients with hematuria. Bladder tumors may be recognized as pedunculated, radiolucent filling defects projecting into the lumen; nonpapillary, infiltrating tumors may result in fixation or flattening of the bladder wall. 4. Urinary tumor markers - - Several new tests have been developed in order to overcome the shocomings of urinary cytology such as the low sensitivity for low-grade superficial tumors and inter-observer variability. - Commercially available tests include, the BTA test, the BTA stat test, the BTA TRAK assay determination of urinary nuclear matrix protein (NMP22), Immunocyt and UroVysion . - These tests can detect cancer specific proteins in urine (BTA/NMP22) or augment cytology by identifying cell surface or cytogenetic markers in the nucleus. Other tests under investigation include identification of the Lewis X antigen on exfoliated urothelial cells, and the determination of telomerase activity in exfoliated cells. - These tests have been demonstrated to enhance detection of bladder cancer when used either individually or in combination with cytology. They have been used to detect both new index tumors as well as recurrent tumors.",symptoms_diagnosis

The RV, the FRC, and the TLC, however, cannot be determined with a spirometer because the subject cannot exhale all the gas in the lungs. The lung volumes not measurable with spirometry can be determined by the nitrogen-washout technique, by the helium-dilution technique, and by body plethysmography. The FRC is usually determined, and RV (which is equal to FRC minus ERV) and the TLC (which is equal to VC plus RV) are then calculated from volumes obtained by spirometry. Ref: Levitzky M.G. (2007).

Atherosclerosis initiation by fibroblast plaque is mediated by injury to ?,,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Endothelium The most acceptable hypothesis for the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is ""the response to injury hypothesis"". According to this hypothesis, atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory response of the aerial wall initiated by injury to endothelium. Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis Following stages occurs in the pathogenesis of Atherosclerosis: Endothelial injury Earliest stages of the development of atherosclerosis are mediated by the inflammatory cascade. Inflammation mediated injury to endothelium is the cornestone in the development of atherosclerosis. After injury, endothelium is activated and there is increased expression of adhesion molecule-VCAM-1 and there is increased permeability to endothelium. TNF is the major cytokine to induce this expression. Migration of leukocytes When VCAM-1 is expressed on endothelium, leukocytes adhere to the endothelium. Leukocytes than cross the endothelial barrier and begin to accumulate in subendothelial intimal space. Macrophages engulf LDL cholesterol and form foam cells - formation of earliest lesion, i.e. fatty streak. Macrophages also form oxygen free radicals that cause oxidation of LDL to yield oxidized LDL (modified LDL). Smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation Inflammatory cells in subendothelial intimal space secrete cytokines, mainly PDGF, TGF-ct and FGF which cause migration of smooth muscle cells from media to subendothelial intimal space as well as their proliferation. Maturation of plaque Smooth muscle cells synthesize extracellular matrix (especially collegen) and conve a fatty streak into a mature fibrofatty atheroma, and contribute to the progressive growth of atherosclerotic lesions.",general_faq

Phagocytosis by Macrophages.
Macrophages are the end-stage product of monocytes that enter the tissues from the blood. When activated by the immune system, they are much more powerful phagocytes than neutrophils, often capable of phagocytizing as many as 100 bacteria. They also have the ability to engulf much larger particles, even whole RBCs or, occasionally, malarial parasites, whereas neutrophils are not capable of phagocytizing particles much larger than bacteria. Also, after digesting particles, macrophages can extrude the residual products and often survive and function for many more months.

Earliest lesion seen in atherosclerosis is:,,"Ans: A (Fatty streaks) Ref: Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease, 8th edition.Explanation:Fatty streaks are the earliest lesions in atherosclerosis "" Ref: RobbinsMorphology of AtherosclerosisFatty StreaksThese are the earliest lesions in atherosclerosis.They are composed of lipid-filled foamy macrophages.Beginning as multiple minute flat yellow spots, they eventually coalesce into elongated streaks 1 cm or more in length.These lesions are not significantly raised and do not cause any flow disturbanceAortas of infants less than 1 year old can exhibit fatty streaks, and such lesions are seen in virtually all children older than 10 years, regardless of geography, race, sex, or environment.The relationship of fatty streaks to atherosclerotic plaques is uncertainThey may evolve into precursors of plaques, not all fatty streaks are destined to become advanced lesions.Atherosclerotic PlaqueThe key processes in atherosclerosis are intimal thickening and lipid accumulationAtheromatous plaques impinge on the lumen of the artery and grossly appear white to yellow: superimposed thrombus over ulcerated plaques is red-brown.Plaques vary from 0.3 to 1.5 cm in diameter but can coalesce to form larger massesAtherosclerotic lesions are patchy, on cross- section, the lesions appear ""eccentric""Local flow disturbances (e.g., turbulence at branch points) leads to increased susceptibility to plaque formation.In descending order, the most extensively involved vessels are theLower abdominal aorta (MC)The coronary arteries (Second MC)The popliteal arteriesThe internal carotid arteriesVessels of the circle of WillisVessels of the upper extremities are usually spared, as are the mesenteric and renal arteries, except at their ostia.Atherosclerotic plaques have three principal components:Cells, including smooth muscle cells, macrophages, and T cellsECM, including collagen, elastic fibers, and proteoglycansIntracellular and extracellular lipidSuperficial fibrous cap composed of smooth muscle cells and dense collagen.Beneath and to the side of the cap (the ""shoulder"") is a more cellular area containing macrophages, T cells, and smooth muscle cells.Deep to the fibrous cap is a necrotic core, containing lipid (primarily cholesterol and cholesterol esters), debris from dead cells, foam cells (lipid-laden macrophages and smooth muscle cells), fibrin, variably organized thrombus, and other plasma proteins and cholesterolThe periphery of the lesions show neovascularization (proliferating small blood vessels;Plaques generally continue to change and progressively enlarge due to cell death and degeneration, synthesis and degradation (remodeling) of ECM, and organization of thrombus.Atheromas often undergo calcificationAtherosclerotic plaques are susceptible to the following clinically important changes* Rupture, ulceration, or erosion of the intimal surface of atheromatous plaques exposes the blood to highly thrombogenic substances and induces thrombosis.* Such thrombosis can partially or completely occlude the lumen and lead to downstream ischemia.* If the patient survives the initial thrombotic occlusion, the clot may become organized and incorporated into the growing plaque.* Hemorrhage into a plaque. Rupture of the overlying fibrous cap, or of the thin-walled vessels in the areas of neovascularization, can cause intra-plaque hemorrhage; a contained hematoma may expand the plaque or induce plaque rupture.* Atheroembolism.

Which of the following is not a component of transpo system?,,"Functions: Transpo Systems An essential role of biomembranes is to allow movement of all compounds necessary for the normal function of a cell across the membrane barrier. These compounds include a vast array of substances like sugars, amino acids, fatty acids, steroids, cations and anions to mention a few. These compounds must enter or leave the cells in an orderly manner for normal functioning of the cell. A. 1. Ion Channels Ion channels are transmembrane channels, pore-like structures composed of proteins. Specific channels for Na+, K+, Ca++, and Cl- have been identified. Cation conductive channels are negatively charged within the channel and have an average diameter of about 5 to 8 nm. All ion channels are basically made up of transmembrane subunits that come together to form a central pore through which ions pass selectively. All channels have gates and are controlled by opening and closing. Types of Gates Two types of gated channels. They are a. Ligand-gated channels: In this, a specific molecule binds to a receptor and opens the channel. Example: Acetylcholine receptor is present in the postsynaptic membrane. It is a complex of five subunits, having a binding site for acetylcholine. Acetylcholine released from the presynaptic region binds with the binding site of the postsynaptic region, which triggers the opening of the channel and influx of Na+. b. Voltage-gated channels: These channels open or close in response to changes in membrane potential. Some propeies of ion channels * Composed of transmembrane protein subunits. * Highly selective. * Well regulated by the presence of ""gates"". * Two main types of gates: Ligand-gated and voltage-gated. * Activities are affected by ceain drugs. * Mutations of genes encoding transmembrane proteins can cause specific diseases. 2. Ionophores Ceain microorganisms can synthesize small organic molecules, called ionophores, which function as shuttles for the movement of ions across the membrane. Structure: These ionophores contain hydrophilic centres that bind specific ions and are surrounded by peripheral hydrophobic regions. Types: Two types: (a) Mobile ion carriers: Like valinomycin (Refer uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation). (b) Channel formers: Like gramicidin. 3. Water Channels (Aquaporins) In ceain cells, e.g. in red blood cells, and cells of the collecting ductules of the kidney, the movement of water by simple diffusion is enhanced by movements of water through water channels, composed of tetrameric transmembrane proteins called aquaporins. About five distinct types of aquaporins have been recognised. CLINICAL ASPECT Recently mutations in the gene encoding AP-2 (Aquaporin 2) protein, have been shown to be the cause of one type of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. 4. Gap Junction Ceain cells develop specialized regions on their membranes for intercellular communications which are in close proximity. Function: They mediate and regulate the passage of ions and small molecules upto 1000 to 2000 mol wt, through a narrow hydrophilic core connecting the cytosol of adjacent cells. Structure: They are primarily composed of protein, called connexon which contains four membrane-spanning a-helices. the mitochondrial membrane also has paicularly energy coupling mechanism.Ref: MN Chatterjea Textbook of Medical Biochemistry, 8th edition",general_faq
Burst supression pattern on EEG is typically seen in:,,"Ref: Ref: Harrisons 18/e p e-45 chapter
 As the depth of coma increases, the EEG becomes nonreactive and may show a burst-suppression pattern, with bursts of mixed-frequency activity separated by intervals of relative cerebral inactivity. In other instances there is a reduction in amplitude of the EEG until eventually activity cannot be detected. Such electrocerebral silence does not necessarily reflect irreversible brain damage, because it may occur in hypothermic patients or with drug overdose.
The prognosis of electrocerebral silence, when recorded using an adequate technique, depends upon the clinical context in which it is found. In patients with severe cerebral anoxia, for example, electrocerebral silence in a technically satisfactory record implies that useful cognitive recovery will not occur.",general_faq

Over time, possibly as a consequence of secondary renal damage, this form of hypeension may become less renin-dependent.As a screening test, renal blood flow may be evaluated with a radionuclide -ohoiodohippurate (OIH) scan, or glomerular filtration rate may be evaluated with a - diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) scan before and after a single dose of captopril (or another ACE inhibitor).Contrast aeriography remains the ""gold standard"" for evaluation and identification of renal aery lesions.Harrison 19e pg: 1618",general_faq

"A 63 year old man presents with a triad of angina, syncope and congestive hea failure. Which of the following valvular hea lesion can be suspected-",,"Even severe AS may exist for many years without producing any symptoms because of the ability of the hyperophied LV to generate the elevated intraventricular pressures required to maintain a normal stroke volume. Most patients with pure or predominant AS have gradually increasing obstruction over years, but do not become symptomatic until the sixth to eighth decades. Exeional dyspnea, angina pectoris, and syncope are the three cardinal symptoms. Dyspnea results primarily from elevation of the pulmonary capillary pressure caused by elevations of LV diastolic pressures secondary to reduced left ventricular compliance and impaired relaxation. Angina pectoris usually develops somewhat later and reflects an imbalance between the augmented myocardial oxygen requirements and reduced oxygen availability. Exeional syncope may result from a decline in aerial pressure caused by vasodilation in the exercising muscles and inadequate vasoconstriction in nonexercising muscles in the face of a fixed CO, or from a sudden fall in CO produced by an arrhythmia.

Mediastinal lymph node calcification is seen in which one of the following-,,"Ref:Robbins Basic Pathology (9th Edition),page no.478,479 Sarcoidosis Although sarcoidosis is considered here as an example of a restrictive lung disease, it is impoant to note that sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease of unknown etiology characterized by noncaseating granulomas in many tissues and organs. MORPHOLOGY The diagnostic histopathologic feature of sarcoidosis is the noncaseating epithelioid granuloma, irrespective of the organ involved. This is a discrete, compact collection of epithelioid cells rimmed by an outer zone of largely CD4+ T cells. The epithelioid cells are derived from macrophages and are characterized by abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei. It is not uncommon to see intermixed multinucleate giant cells formed by fusion of macrophages. A thin layer of laminated fibroblasts is present peripheral to the granuloma; over time, these proliferate and lay down collagen that replaces the entire granuloma with a hyalinized scar. Two other microscopic features are sometimes seen in the granulomas: (1) Schaumann bodies, laminated concretions composed of calcium and proteins; and (2) asteroid bodies, stellate inclusions enclosed within giant cells. Their presence is not required for diagnosis of sarcoidosis--they also may occur in granulomas of other origins. Rarely, foci of central necrosis may be present in sarcoid granulomas, suggesting an infectious process. Caseation necrosis typical of tuberculosis is absent The lungs are involved at some stage of the disease in 90% of patients. The granulomas predominantly involve the interstitium rather than air spaces, with some tendency to localize in the connective tissue around bronchioles and pulmonary venules and in the pleura (""lymphangitic"" distribution). The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid contains abundant CD4+ T cells. In 5% to 15% of patients, the granulomas eventually are replaced by diffuse interstitial fibrosis, resulting in a so-called honeycomb lung. Intrathoracic hilar and paratracheal lymph nodes are enlarged and calcification in 75% to 90% of patients, while a third present with peripheral lymphadenopathy. The nodes are characteristically painless and have a firm, rubbery texture. Unlike in tuberculosis, lymph nodes in sarcoidosis are ""nonmatted"" (nonadherent) and do not ulcerate.",general_faq

(Option a)Reduced fetal urine production may contribute to oligohydramnios and pulmonary hypoplasia.About 30% of affected neonates die shortly after birth due to respiratory insufficiency. Close to 60% of mortality occurs within the first month of life.In the classic group, most patients are bom with renal insufficiency and ESRD (End stage renal disease). (Option b)However, infants often have a transient improvement in their GFR; death from renal insufficiency at this stage is rare.Some patients are diagnosed after the neonatal stage and form the older group. Morbidity and mortality in this group often involve systemic hypertension, progressive renal insufficiency, and liver manifestations.The hallmarks of ARPKD liver disease are biliary dysgenesis due to a primary ductal plate malformation with associated periportal fibrosis, namely congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) and dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts (Caroli's disease). CHF and Caroli's disease can then lead to portal hypertension exhibiting hepatosplenomegaly, variceal bleeding, and cholangitis.Some patients with the diagnosis of ARPKD at 1 year of age with nephromegaly exhibit slowly declining renal function over 20 years with only minimally enlarged kidneys at ESRD (Option c and e) and markedly atrophic kidneys following renal transplantation.The slow progression of renal disease is likely due to increasing fibrosis rather than the development of cysts.Systemic hypertension is common in all ARPKD patients, even those with normal renal function.

Iliac crest involvement is common in which condition: March 2007,,"Ans. A: Ankylosing Spondylitis The basic pathologic lesion of ankylosing spondylitis occurs at the entheses, which are sites of attachment to bone of ligaments, tendons, and joint capsules. Enthesopathy results from inflammation, with subsequent calcification and ossification at and around the entheses. Inflammation with cellular infiltration by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes is associated with erosion and eburnation of the subligamentous bone. The process usually stas at the sacroiliac joints. Other enthesopathic sites include the iliac crest, ischial tuberosity, greater trochanter, patella, and calcaneum. Ankylosing spondylitis/ AS/ Bechterew's disease/ Bechterew syndrome/ Marie Strumpell disease/Spondyloahritis is a chronic, painful, degenerative inflammatory ahritis primarily affecting spine and sacroiliac joints, causing eventual fusion of the spine. AS is a systemic rheumatic disease and one of the seronegative spondyloahropathies. About 90% of the patients express the HLA-B27 genotype. Men are affected more than women by a ratio in excess of 10:1. Typical signs of progressed AS are the visible formation of syndesmophytes on X-rays and abnormal bone outgrowths similar to osteophytes affecting the spine. Complete fusion results in a complete rigidity of the spine, a condition known as bamboo spine. In 40% of cases, ankylosing spondylitis is associated with iridocyclitis causing eye pain and photophobia. 4.1 AS is also associated with ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, and Reiter's disease Other complications are aoic regurgitation, Achilles tendinitis, AV node block and amyloidosis & restrictive lung disease.

The number of ATPs generated in krebs cycleare ?,,"Ans. is 'b' > b' i.e., 24 One turn of the TCA cycle, staing with acetyl CoA produces 10 ATPs. When the staing molecule is pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate yields 2.5 ATPs and therefore, 12.5 ATPs are produced when staing compound is pyruvate. Since, two molecules of pyruvate enter the TCA cycle when glucose is metabolized (glycolysis produces 2 molecules of pyruvate), the number of ATPs is doubled. Therefore, 25 ATP molecules, per glucose molecule, are produced when pyruvate enters the TCA cycle.Note : Previously calculations were made assuming that NADH produces 3 ATPs and FADH generates 2 ATPs. This will amount a net generation of 30 ATP molecules in TCA per molecule glucose and total 38 molecules from staing. Recent experiments show that these values are overestimates and NADH produces 2.5 ATPs and FADH produces 1.5 ATPs. Therefore, net generation during TCA is 25 ATPs and complete oxidation of glucose through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle yield a net 32 ATPs.Energy yield (number of ATP generated) per molecule of glucose when it is completely oxidized through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle, under aerobic conditions, is as follows :- Method ofNo of ATPsNo of ATPsPathwayStepEnzymeSource ATP formationgained perglucose(new calculation)As per oldcalculationGlycolysis1Hexokinase MinusMinus 1Do3Phosphofructokinase MinusMinus 1Do5Glyceraldehyde-3-p DHNADH Respiratory chain2.5 x 2 = 53 x 2 = 6Do61,3-BPGkinase ATPSubstrate level1 x 2 -- 21 x 2 = 2Do9Pyruvate kinaseATP Substrate level1 x 2 = 21 x 2 = 2Pyruvate to?PyruvateNADH Respiratory chain2.5x2= 53x2= 6Acetyl CoA Dehydrogenase TCA cycle3Isocitrate DHNADH Respiratory chain2.5x2= 53 x 2= 6Do4Alpha keto glutarate DHNADH Respiratory chain2.5x2= 53x2= 6Do5Succinate thiokinaseGTP Substrate level1 x 2 = 21 x 2 = 2Do6Succicinate DHFADH2Respiratory chain1.5x2= 32 x 2= 4Do8Malate DHNADH Respiratory chain2.5x2= 53 x 2= 6Net generation in glycolytic pathway 9 minus 2= 7 10 minus 2= 8Generation in pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction 5 * 6Generation in citric acid cycle 20 * 24Net generation of ATP from one glucose mole 32 * 38",general_faq

"A female child with virilization, hypertension with low plasma renin diagnosis is :",,"9] Congenital adrenal hyperplasia represents a group of autosomal recessive inherited, metabolic errors,
each characterized by decency or total lack of a particular enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of cortical steroids,
Steroidogenesis is then channelled into other pathways leading to increased production of androgens,
which accounts for virilization.
Simultaneously, the decency of cortisol results in increased secretion of ACTH resulting in adrenal hyperplasia.
Following enzymes are implicated in the congenital adrenal hyperplasia 21 α hydroxylase decency (partial or complete) 17 α hydroxylase deficiency 11β hydroxylase
deficiency 21 α hydroxylase deficiency
• Two forms of this deficiency include -
A. Salt-wasting adrenogenital ism
B. Simple Virilizing adrenogenital ism
A) Salt-wasting syndrome (complete lack) The salt wasting syndrome results from complete lack of 21 hydroxylases.
There is no synthesis of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids in the adrenal cortex.
Decreased mineralocorticoids causes marked sodium loss in the urine, resulting in hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis and hypotension.
Because of the enzyme block, there is increased formation of 17 - hydroxyprogesterone, which is then shunted into the production of testosterone.
This may cause virilism (pseudo-hermaphroditism) in female infants.
That is (XX) Female with 21 hydroxylase deficiency develops ovaries,
female ductal structures and external male genitalia. But in the male child, the effect of increased testosterone will not be manifested at the time of birth.
The complete21 hydroxylase deficiency or salt wasting syndrome usually comes to light only after the birth because in utero the electrolytes and uids
can be maintained by maternal kidneys. Males with this disorder comes to clinical attention 5 to 15 days later because of salt losing crisis while
females come to attention soon after the birth because of the virilization.
B) Simple Virilizing adrenogenital syndrome (Partial deficiency) Occurs in individuals
with partial deficiency of 21 hydroxylases Less severe deficiency of mineralocorticoid, is sufficient for salt reabsorption, but the lowered glucocorticoid fails to cause
feedback inhibition of ACTH secretion.
Thus level of aldosterone is mildly reduced, testosterone is increased and ACTH elevated with resultant adrenal hyperplasia.
11B hydroxylase deficiency-. Rare Leads to decreased cortisol and increased ACTH.
This, in turn, leads to the accumulation of DOC (deoxycorticosterone) and 11 deoxycortisol
both of which are strong mineralocorticoids. This results in increased sodium retention by the kidneys and hypertension, hypokalemia.
Patients also develop virilization due to androgen excess. 17 α hydroxylase deficiency - Patients with deficiency of 17 hydroxylases also have impaired cortisol production,
increased ACTH and secondary increased DOC.
These patients, however, cannot synthesize normal amount of androgens and estrogens.
This is because the gene that codes for 17 α hydroxylase is the same for the enzyme in the adrenal cortex and the gonads and the decency is same in both organs.
Because of decreased sex hormones, genotypic females develop primary amenorrhoea and fail to develop secondary sex characteristics while genotypic
males will present as pseudohermaphrodite.
3 β hydroxylase deficiency 3-β hydroxylase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder of steroid biosynthesis that results
in decreased production of all three groups of adrenal steroids which include mineralocorticoid, glucocorticoid and sex steroids.
Decreased mineralocorticoid secretion
results in varying degrees of salt wasting in both males and females.
Decent androgen production results in ambiguous genitalia in males
The usual presentation is a male child with ambiguous genitalia and severe salt wasting. Sometimes it may also occur in females",general_faq

Dentinal dysplasia is an inherited condition affecting both dentitions. It is divided into two types: Type I (radicular dentinal dysplasia) and Type II (coronal dentinal dysplasia). It occurs less frequently than dentinogenesis imperfecta.
Clinical features
Type I is the more frequent type. Teeth erupt normally with no obvious abnormality but rapidly develop mobility resulting from limited root support. In type II, the deciduous teeth are similar to those in dentinogenesis imperfecta, whereas the permanent teeth appear normal.
Radiological signs
In Type I, all the teeth, except the canines, have extremely short roots. The roots are conical or blunted. There is pulpal obliteration and the inferior aspects of the crown exhibit linear crescent-shaped radiolucent lines. Periapical radiolucencies are commonly seen associated with non-carious teeth in Type I dentinal dysplasia. In Type II dentinal dysplasia, obliteration of the pulp occurs post eruption in the deciduous dentition. In the permanent dentition, there is alteration in the configuration of the pulp resulting in enlarged pulp chambers extending well down into the root. The pulp contains multiple calcifications.

"Most serious complication seen in other eye after traumatic injury to one eye: March 2005, September 2008",,"Ans. C: Sympathetic ophthalmia Sympathetic ophthalmia (SO) is a condition in which serious inflammation attacks the sound eye after injury (including intraocular surgeries) to the other. It is the most dreaded complication of unilateral severe eye injury, as it can leave the patient completely blind. Symptoms may develop from days to several years after a penetrating eye injury. Sympathetic ophthalmia is thought to be an autoimmune inflammatory response toward ocular antigens, specifically a delayed hypersensitivity to melanin-containing structures from the outer segments of the photoreceptor layer of the retina. It is thought that Louis Braille, who injured his left eye as a child, lost vision in his right eye due to SO Floating spots and loss of accommodation are among the earliest symptoms. The disease may progress to severe iridocyclitis with pain and photophobia. Commonly the eye remains relatively painless while the inflammatory disease spreads through the uvea. The retina, however, usually remains uninvolved. Papilledema, secondary glaucoma, vitiligo and poliosis of the eyelashes may accompany SO. Diagnosis is clinical, seeking a history of eye injury. An impoant differential diagnosis is Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (VKH), which is thought to have the same pathogenesis, without a history of surgery or penetrating eye injury. Definitive prevention of SO requires prompt (within the first 7 to 10 days following injury) enucleation of the injured eye. Evisceration--the removal of the contents of the globe while leaving the sclera and extraocular muscles intact--is easier to perform, offers long-term orbital stability, and is more aesthetically pleasing. But evisceration may lead to a higher incidence of SO compared to enucleation. Immunosuppressive therapy is the mainstay of treatment for SO. When initiated promptly following injury, it is effective in controlling the inflammation and improving the prognosis.",general_faq

Post traumatic stress disorder is differentiated from other anxiety disorders by which of the following symptoms?,,"This question is not about the diagnostic features of PTSD. This is about the differential diagnosis. PTSD is an anxiety disorder and it shares symptoms with other disorders. Impoant features in distinguishing the condition are given below. Differential diagnosis: Point 1: Etiologically significant trauma should be present for a diagnosis of PTSD. E.g. A traumatic event in the past. Point 2: 'Intentionality' or 'aboutness' is an impoant factor for PTSD. Nightmares, flashbacks or reliving experiences should be related to the past event. PTSD concerns memory - Intrusion of past stressors into the present. Point 3: Avoid a 'stimulus' or 'activity' that provokes the memory of the past event. In the above question, only reliving experience is mentioned as connected to the past experiences. Hence, that is the answer for this question.

Which of the following nerve is involved in Frey's syndrome?,,"Syndrome (Gustatory Sweating) aka auriculotemporal syndrome: Frey's syndrome arises as a complication of parotid surgery usually manifesting several months after the operation. lt is characterised by sweating and flushing of the preauricular skin during mastication causing nuisance to the person or social embarrassment. It is the result of damage to auriculotemporal nerve and aberrant innervation of sweat glands by parasympathetic secretomotor fibres which were destined for the parotid. Now instead of causing salivary secretion from the parotid, they cause secretion from the sweat glands. The condition can be treated by tympanic neurectomy which intercepts these parasympathetic fibres at the level of middle ear. Some people like to place a sheet of fascia lata between the skin and the underlying fat to prevent secretomotor fibres reaching the sweat glands. Generally, no treatment other than reassurance is required in most of these patients. Also known as Crocodile tears (gustatory lacrimation): There is unilateral lacrimation with mastication. This is due to faulty regeneration of parasympathetic fibres which now supply lacrimal gland instead of the salivary glands. It can be treated by section of greater superficial petrosal nerve or tympanic neurectomy.",general_faq

Which of the following is the most appropriate management strategy for this patient?",,"The initial, and often definitive, management of hyponatremia is free-water restriction. Symptomatic hyponatremia, which occurs at serum sodium levels less than or equal to 120 mEq/L, can result in headache, seizures, coma, and signs of increased intracranial pressure and may require infusion of hypeonic saline. Rapid correction should be avoided so as not to cause central pontine myelinolysis, manifested by neurologic symptoms ranging from seizures to brain damage and death. Additionally, a search for the underlying etiology of the hyponatremia should be undeaken. Acute severe hyponatremia sometimes occurs following elective surgical procedures due to a combination of appropriate stimulation of antidiuretic hormone and injudicious administration of excess free water in the first few postoperative days. Other potential etiologies include hyperosmolarity with free-water shifts from the intra- to the extracellular compament (eg, hyperglycemia), sodium depletion (eg, gastrointestinal or renal losses, insufficient intake), dilution (eg, drug-induced), and the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).",symptoms_diagnosis

T cells are absent in the lymph nodes, spleen, and peripheral blood, and infants with this defect are extremely vulnera- ble to viral, fungal, and protozoal infections. Patients are also susceptible to infection with intracellular bacteria, because of defective T cell-mediated immunity. B cells and serum immunoglobulins are generally unaffected. The disorder is a consequence of a developmental mal- formation affecting the third and fouh pharyngeal pouches, structures that give rise to the thymus, parathy- roid glands, and poions of the face and aoic arch. Thus, in addition to the thymic and T cell defects, there may be parathyroid gland hypoplasia, resulting in hypocalce- mic tetany, as well as additional midline developmental abnormalities.

Enterobius commonly inhabit the: September 2011,,"Ans. D: Caecum Adult Enterobius vermicularis worms inhabit the caecum, appendix and adjacent poions of the ascending colon, lying closely applied to the mucosal surface. Pinworm (genus En terobius)/Threadworm/Seatworm, It is a nematode (roundworm) and a common human intestinal parasite, especially in children. It inhabits the caecum, appendix and adjacent poion of the ascending colon, lying closely applied to the mucosal surface It causes enterobiasis, or less precisely as oxyuriasis in reference to the family Oxyuridae. The pinworm appears as a white, small and delicate nematode. The adult female has a sharply pointed posterior end, is 8 to 13 millimeters long, and 0.5 millimeter thick. The adult male is considerably smaller, measuring 2 to 5 millimeters long and 0.2 millimeter thick, and has a curved posterior end. The eggs are translucent and have a surface that adheres to environmental objects. The eggs measure 50 to 60 micrometers by 20 to 30 micrometers, and have a thick shell that is flattened on one side. The small size and colorlessness of the eggs make them invisible to the naked eye, except in barely visible clumps of thousands of eggs. Eggs may contain a developing embryo or a fully developed pinworm larva.Inside the host, the larvae grow to 140-150 micrometers in length Pinworms spread through human-to-human transmission, by ingesting (i.e., swallowing) infectious pinworm eggs and/or by anal sex. The eggs are hardy and can remain ble (i.e., infectious) in a moist environment for up to three weeks.They do not tolerate heat well, but can survive in low temperatures: two-thirds of the eggs are still ble after 18 hours at -8 degrees Celsius (18 degF). After the eggs have been initially deposited near the anus, they are readily transmitted to other surfaces through contamination. The surface of the eggs is sticky when laid, and the eggs are readily transmitted from their initial deposit near the anus to fingernails, hands, night-clothing and bed linen.From here, eggs are fuher transmitted to food, water, furniture, toys, bathroom fixtures and other objects.Household pets often carry the eggs in their fur, while not actually being infected. Dust containing eggs can become airborne and widely dispersed when dislodged from surfaces, for instance when shaking out bed clothes and linen.Consequently the eggs can enter the mouth and nose through inhalation, and be swallowed later. Although pinworms do not strictly multiply inside the body of their human host, some of the pinworm larvae may hatch on the anal mucosa, and migrate up the bowel and back into the gastrointestinal tract of the original host. This process is called retroinfection. Despite the limited, 13 week lifespan of individual pinworms, autoinfection (i.e., infection from the original host to itself), either through the anus-to-mouth route or through retroinfection, causes the pinworms to inhabit the same host indefinitely",general_faq

Storage form of thyroid hormone-,,"The synthesis and storage of thyroid hormones occurs between the follicular cells and the colloid. The storage form of thyroid hormone is thyroglobulin. Thyroglobulin is a large glycoprotein synthesized in the follicular cells and has a molecular weight of around 650 000 with about 140 tyrosine residues, depending on the form of thyroglobulin. Approximately one quaer of these residues is iodinated at the apical-colloid interface. Once iodinated, thyroglobulin is taken up into the colloid of the follicle where, still incorporated in the protein, a coupling reaction between pairs of iodinated tyrosine molecules occurs. The coupling of two tyrosine residues each iodinated at two positions (di-iodotyrosine, DIT) produces tetra-iodothyronine or thyroxine (T4 ) whilst the combination of DIT with mono-iodotyrosine (MIT) produces tri-iodothyronine (T3 ). Such coupling can occur within a single molecule of thyroglobulin or between dimerized molecules of the protein. This coupling is catalyzed by TPO. Thyroid hormones are stored in this state and are only released when the thyroglobulin molecule is taken back up into the follicular cells. Stimulated by TSH, thyroglobulin droplets are captured by the follicular cells by a process of pinocytosis. Fusion of the droplets with lysosomes results in hydrolysis of the thyroglobulin molecules and release of T3 and T4.

MHC restriction is a pa of all except aEUR',,"Autoimmune disorder Major histocompatibility complex : Major histocompatibility complex, also called the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) complex is a 4 megahase region on chromosome 6. This region is densely packed with genes. These genes encodes two major proteins or antigens i.e., MHC I & MHC II. These proteins play an impoant role in the differentiation of foreign cells from host cell. Presence of these proteins is necessary for identification of host cells. Identification of the cells is impoant for immune responses. If the cell is recognised as self, the immune system will not mount an immune response against it. How does MHC helps in this ??? Cells continuously display small pieces of their own internal protein, carrying them, outsie the cell membrane where the immune system can see them. These peptides are just pieces of the normal proteins found inside the cell. These peptides are held together at the cell surface by major histocompatibility complex, which holds these peptides together for the immune system to examine them. Each persons immune system is customized early in life to ignore these peptides, so healthy cells are not able to trigger the immune system and they are left alone. But if any virus or other microorganism is multiplying inside the cell, the peptides synthesized by it also is displayed on the surface. The MHC displays these unusual (foreign) protein on the surface of the cell. The immune system is triggered because of these peptides, staing, a series of event that will eventually lead to killing of the cell containing foreign peptide. MHC is also the cause of tissue rejection during skin grafts and organ grafts. This is how the MHC protein got its name; the term histocompatibility refers to the difficulty of finding compatible grafts between a donor and a patient. Each person has their own collection of MHC molecules. If you graft a piece of skin that has a different collection of MHC types they will trigger the immune system to destroy the cell. So a compatible donor is needed such as a relative who has a similar collection of MHC molecules. MHC is also active against cancer Cancer cells, like normal cells, display pieces of their own protein on their surface. So if any of these proteins carries recognizable cancer mutations, this provides a signal to the immune system that something is wrong and the cell is killed. MHC plays role in activation of T helper cells (Th) MHC class II molecules are present on the membranes of dendritic cells, macrophages. These cell function as antigen presenting cell during immune response. They capture the antigen and present it to T helper cells. In response, the T helper cells secrete cytokines that stimulate B cell proliferation and antibody production. The impoant point about T helper cells is that they respond to only those antigens which have been presented to them by cells that have host matching MHC complex on the presenting cell. In general the antigen presenting cell .first phagocytoses the protein antigen and cleaves it to peptides in the lysosomes. These peptides are then extruded and attached to the presenting cell's surface MHC complex. T helper cells first, make sure, that these MHC class II molecules are host's own MHC and then responds appropriately. So, we can say that receptor on the T helper cell is thus responsive to the combination of antigen and host matching MHC complex on the presenting cell.

However, the use of these tools to cardiac imaging is severely limited because of motion aifacts produced by constantly in motion hea completing an entire cycle of contraction and relaxation in about 1 second.- So radiological cardiac imaging requires a 'window' of minimum cardiac motion to reduce motion aifacts and achieve meaningful images.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in this patient's management?",,"In the absence of peritoneal signs, angiography is the diagnostic test of choice for acute mesenteric ischemia. Patients with peritoneal signs should undergo emergent laparotomy. Acute mesenteric ischemia may be difficult to diagnose. The condition should be suspected in patients with either systemic manifestations of aeriosclerotic vascular disease or low cardiac-output states associated with a sudden development of abdominal pain that is out of propoion to the physical findings. Because of the risk of progression to small-bowel infarction, acute mesenteric ischemia is an emergency and timely diagnosis is essential. Although patients may have lactic acidosis or leukocytosis, these are late findings. Abdominal films are generally unhelpful and may show a nonspecific ileus pattern. Since the pathology involves the small bowel, a barium enema is not indicated. Upper gastrointestinal series and ultrasonography are also of limited value. CT scanning is a good initial test, but should still be followed by angiography in a patient with clinically suspected acute mesenteric ischemia, even in the absence of findings on the CT scan. In addition to establishing the diagnosis in this stable patient, angiography may also assist with operative planning and elucidation of the etiology of the acute mesenteric ischemia. The cause may be embolic occlusion or thrombosis of the superior mesenteric aery, primary mesenteric venous occlusion, or nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia secondary to low-cardiac output states. A moality of 50% to 75% is repoed.

It is about 10% of total activity and is increased in obstructive jaundice and to some extent in metastatic carcinoma of liver.# Alpha-2 heat labile ALP is stable at 56degC; but loses its activity when kept at 65degC for 30 minutes. It is produced by hepatic cells. Therefore, exaggerated alpha-2 band suggests hepatitis. This liver iso-enzyme forms about 25% of total ALP.# Alpha-2 heat stable ALP will not be destroyed at 65degC, but is inhibited by phenylalanine. It is of placental origin, which is found in blood in normal pregnancy. An iso-enzyme closely resembling the placental form is characteristically seen in circulation in about 15% cases of carcinoma of lung, liver and gut and named as Regan iso-enzyme (after the first patient in whom it was detected) or carcinoplacental iso-enzyme. Chronic heavy smoking also increases Regan iso-enzyme level in blood. Normal level is only 1% of the total ALP.# Pre-beta ALP is of bone origin and elevated levels are seen in bone diseases. This is most heat labile (destroyed at 56degC, 10 min). Wheat germ lectin will precipitate bone isoenzyme. This constitutes about 50% of normal ALP activity.# Gamma-ALP is inhibited by phenylalanine and originates from intestinal cells. It is increased in ulcerative colitis. About 10% of plasma ALP are of intestinal variety.# Leucocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) is significantly decreased in chronic myeloid leukemia. It is increased in lymphomas and leukemoid reactions.ALANINE AMINO TRANSFERASE (ALT)# It is also called as serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT).# The enzyme needs pyridoxal phosphate as co-enzyme.# Normal serum level of AL T for male is 13^4-0 U/L and for female is 10-28 U/L.# Very high values (100 to 1000 U/L) are seen in acute hepatitis, either toxic or viral in origin.# Both ALT and AST levels are increased in liver disease, but ALT > AST.# Moderate increase (25 to 100 U/L) may be seen in chronic liver diseases such as cirrhosis, Hepatoma.# A sudden fall in ALT level in cases of hepatitis is very bad prognostic sign.NUCLEOTIDE PHOSPHATASE# It is also known as 5' nucleotidase.# It is a marker enzyme for plasma membranes and is seen as an ecto-enzyme (enzyme present on the cell membrane).# Serum samples contain both ALP and NTP.# These are distinguished by Nickel ions which inhibit NTP but not ALP.- Normal NTP level in serum is 2-10 IU/L.

Treatment of Choice in Sleep Apnea Syndrome:,,"(A) Continuous positive pressure ventilation# Sleep apnea: Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep. Each episode, called an apnea, lasts long enough so that one or more breaths are missed, and such episodes occur repeatedly throughout sleep.> The standard definition of any apneic event includes a minimum 10 second interval between breaths, with either a neurological arousal (a 3-second or greater shift in EEG frequency, measured at C3, C4, O1, or O2), a blood oxygen desaturation of 3-4deg/: or greater, or both arousal and desaturation. Sleep apnea is diagnosed with an overnight sleep test called a polysomnogram, or a ""Sleep Study"".> Treatment: The most common treatment and arguably the most consistently effective treatment for sleep apnea is the use of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device, which 'splints' the patient's airway open during sleep by means of a flow of pressurized air into the throat. However the CPAP machine only assists inhaling whereas a BiPAP machine assists with both inhaling and exhaling, and is used in more severe cases. Medications like Acetazolamide lower blood pH and encourage respiration. Low doses of oxygen are also used as a treatment for hypoxia but are discouraged due to side effects.",nutrition_advice

Ulipristal acetate is a/an:,,"Ans. is d, i.e. Selective progesterone receptor modulatorRef: Harrison's Principles of Internal medicine 19th/ed, p2391Ulipristal acetate (trade name Ella One in the European Union, Ella in the US for contraception, and Esmya for uterine fibroid) is a selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM).PharmacodynamicsAs an SPRM, ulipristal acetate has partial agonistic as well as antagonistic effects on the progesterone receptor. It also binds to the glucocorticoid receptor, but is only a weak anti-glucocorticoid relative to mifepristone, and has no relevant affinity to the estrogen, androgen and mineralocorticoid receptors. Phase II clinical trials suggest that the mechanism might consist of blocking or delaying ovulation and of delaying the maturation of the endometrium.Medical Uses* Emergency contraception: For emergency contraception, a 30mg tablet is used within 120 hours (5 days) after an unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure. It has been shown to prevent about 60% of expected, pregnancies, and prevents more pregnancies than emergency contraception with levonorgestrel.* Treatment of uterine fibroids: Ulipristal acetate is used for preoperative treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age in a daily dose of a 5mg tablet. Treatment of uterine fibroids with ulipristal acetate for 13 weeks effectively controlled excessive bleeding due to uterine fibroids and reduced the size of the fibroids.InteractionsUlipristal acetate is metabolized by CYP3A4 in vitro. Ulipristal acetate is likely to interact with substrates of CYP3A4, like rifampicin, phenytoin, St John's wort, carbamazepine or ritonavir. Therefore, concomitant use with these agents is not recommended. It might also interact with hormonal contraceptives and progestogens such as levonorgestrel and other substrates of the progesterone receptor, as well as with glucocorticoids.Adverse EffectsCommon side effects include abdominal pain and temporary menstrual irregularity or disruption. Headache and nausea were observed under long-term administration (12 weeks), but not after a single dose.ContraindicationsUlipristal acetate should not be taken by women with severe liver diseases because of its CYP-mediated metabolism. It has not been studied in women under the age of 18.Pregnancy: Unlike levonorgestrel, and like mifepristone, ulipristal acetate is embryotoxic in animal studies. Before taking the drug, a pregnancy must be excluded.",general_faq
A patient presented with ahritis and purpura. Laboratory examination showed monoclonal and polyclonal cryoglobulins. Histopathology showed deposits of cryoglobulins around the vessels. The patient should be tested for which of the following ?,,"Hepatitis C This is caused by an RNA flavivirus. Acute symptomatic infection with hepatitis C is rare. Most individuals are unaware of when they became infected and are identified only when they develop chronic liver disease. Eighty per cent of individuals exposed to the virus become chronically infected and late spontaneous viral clearance is rare. There is no active or passive protection against hepatitis C virus (HCV). Hepatitis C infection is usually identified in asymptomatic individuals screened because they have risk factors for infection, such as previous injecting drug use , or have incidentally been found to have abnormal liver blood tests. Although most people remain asymptomatic until progression to cirrhosis occurs, fatigue can complicate chronic infection and is unrelated to the degree of liver damage. Hepatitis C is the most common cause of what used to be known as 'non-A, non-B hepatitis'. If hepatitis C infection is left untreated, progression from chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis occurs over 20-40 years. Risk factors for progression include male gender, immunosuppression (such as co-infection with HIV), prothrombotic states and heavy alcohol misuse. Not everyone with hepatitis C infection will necessarily develop cirrhosis but approximately 20% do so within 20 years. Once cirrhosis has developed, the 5- and 10-year survival rates are 95% and 81%, respectively. One-quaer of people with cirrhosis will develop complications within 10 years and, once complications such as ascites develop, the 5-year survival is around 50%.

This procedure involves the visual identification of demineralized  areas  (typically  white  spots)  or  suspicious pits or fissures and the use of the dental explorer to determine the  presence of a  loss of continuity  or breaks in the enamel and to assess the softness or resilience of the enamel. Caries lesions located on interproximal tooth surfaces  have  generally  been  detected  with  the  use  of  bitewing radiographs. These procedures have been used routinely in virtually every dental office in the United States for the past 50 years. Tactile probing with an explorer is no longer used for caries detection in most European countries, and this protocol has now been adopted by many U.S. dental schools. The primary concerns that led to the discontinuation of the probing procedure were as follows:
1. The  insertion  of  the  explorer  into  the  suspected lesion inevitably disrupts the surface layer covering very early lesions, thereby eliminating the possibility for remineralization of the decalcified area;

This patient's paraneoplastic syndrome is most likely the result of ectopic production of",,"Symptoms not caused by either local or metastatic effects of tumors are called paraneoplastic syndromes. Bronchogenic carcinomas are associated with the development of many different types of paraneoplastic syndromes. These syndromes are usually associated with the secretion of ceain substances by the tumor cells. For example, ectopic secretion of ACTH may produce Cushing's syndrome, while ectopic secretion of antidiuretic hormone (syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion) may produce hyponatremia. Hypocalcemia may result from the production of calcitonin, while hypercalcemia may result from the production of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), which is a normal substance produced locally by many different types of tissue. PTHrP is distinct from parathyroid hormone (PTH) patients with this type of paraneoplastic syndrome have increased calcium levels and decreased PTH levels. As a result of decreased PTH production, all of the parathyroid glands in these patients are atrophic. Other tumors associated with the production of PTHrP include clear cell carcinomas of the kidney, endometrial adenocarcinomas, and transitional carcinomas of the urinary bladder. Lung cancers are also associated with multiple, migratory venous thromboses. This migratory thrombophlebitis is called Trousseau's sign and is more classically associated with carcinoma of the pancreas. Hyperophic osteoahropathy is a syndrome consisting of periosteal new bone formation with or without digital clubbing and joint effusion. It is most commonly found in association with lung carcinoma, but it also occurs with other types of pulmonary disease. Erythrocytosis is associated with increased erythropoietin levels and some tumors, paicularly renal cell carcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, and cerebellar hemangioblastomas.

Jones Criteria for Diagnosis of Rheumatic Fever Major Criteria Carditis Pancarditis, seen in 50-60% of patients, develops within the first 2 weeks of rheumatic fever. Pericarditis is evidenced by presence of a pericardial rub, myocarditis by tachycardia, soft S1, presence of S3 and CCF and endocarditis by the presence of Carey-Coombs' murmur (mitral diastolic murmur). Ahritis (60-75%) Flitting and fleeting type of polyahritis involving large joints with no residual deformity is seen in 60-75% of patients and occurs early in rheumatic fever. Jaccod's ahritis: Ulnar detion of 4th and 5th finger with flexion at metacarpophalangeal joints is the only residual deformity seen in rheumatic polyahritis. Subcutaneous Nodules Non-tender nodules are seen over bony prominences like elbows, shin, occiput, spine in 3-5% of patients and occur 3-6 weeks after onset of rheumatic fever. Patients who have subcutaneous nodules almost always have carditis. Erythema Marginatum (< 5% and evanescent) Macular lesions with an erythematous rim and central clearing in a bathing suit distribution are seen in < 5% of patients and occur early in rheumatic fever. Chorea (Sydenham's Chorea) (2-30%) A neurological disorder with rapid, involuntary and purposeless non-repetitive movements with a self limiting course of 2-6 weeks is more common in females and is a late manifestation of rheumatic fever. Minor Criteria Clinical 1. Fever 2. Ahralgia 3. Previous history of rheumatic fever or rheumatic hea disease. Laboratory 1. Acute phase reactants (leucocytosis, raised ESR, C-reactive protein) 2.

Pregnancy tests utilize the measurement of hCG for detection of the embryo. Endothelial growth factor (EGF) is synthesized by the cytotrophoblast cells in the early placenta, then is synthesized by the syncytiotrophoblast cells later (6-8 week old placenta). EGF maintains the trophoblast. Relaxin is synthesized by decidual cells at the time of paurition and acts to ""soften"" the cervix and pelvic ligaments.

Effective red cell diameter,,"Answer: (C) Thalassemia minor anemia may present with normal RBC diameter (265-68-Hrshmohon 7th) (630= Rabbins- basis disease)Red blood cell distribution width (RDW or RCDW) is a measure of the variation of red blood cell (RBC) volume that is reported as part of a standard complete blood count. Usually red blood cells are a standard size of about 6-8 pm in diameter. Certain disorders, however, cause a significant variation in cell size. Higher RDW values indicate greater variation in size. Normal reference range in human red blood cells is 11.5-14.5%. If anemia is observed, RDW test results are often used together with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) results to determine the possible causes of the anemia. It is mainly used to differentiate an anemia of mixed causes from an anemia of a single cause. Deficiencies of Vitamin Bl2 orfolate produce a macrocytic anemia (large cell anemia) in which the RDW is elevated in roughly two- thirds of all cases; however, a varied size distribution of red blood cells is a hallmark of iron deficiency anemia, and as such shows an increased RDW in virtually all cases. In the case of a mixed iron and B!2 deficiency, there will normally be a mix of both large cells and small cells, causing the RDW to be elevated. An elevated RDW (red blood cells of unequal sizes) is known as anisocytosis. An elevation in the RDW is not characteristic of all anemias; anemia of chronic disease,hereditary spherocytosis, acute blood loss, aplastic anemia (anemia resulting from an inability of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells), and certain hereditary hemoglobinopathies (including some cases of thalassemia minor) all may present with a normal RDW* The human erythrocyte is a biconcave disc, 7-2 pm in diameter, and has a thickness of 2-4 pm at the periphery and 1 mm in the centre* More than 90% of the weight of erythrocytes consists of haemoglobin.

Signal from Baroreceptors goes to -,,"Ans. is C Nucleus of tractus solitarius o Baroreceptors are mechanoreceptors that are located in the adventia of carotid artery and aorta, at specialized locations called sinuses. Carotid sinus is a little bulge at the root of internal carotid artery, located just above the bifurcation of the common carotid artery. It is innerv ated by the sinus nerve, a branch of glossopharyngeal (IX cranial) nerve. Aortic arch (aortic sinus) also contains mechenoreceptors (stretch receptors) which are similar to carotid sinus receptors. However, their afferent nerve fibers travel in the aortic nerve, a branch of Vagus (X cranial) nerve. o The sinus nerve (from carotid sinus) and aortic nerve/vagal fibers (from aortic sinus) are together called 'Sino- aortic nerves'. They, together, are also refered to as 'Buffer nerves' because they are the afferents of cardiovascular reflexes that buffer abrupt changes in blood pressure. o Baroreceptors are highly sensitive to any change in mean blood pressure. Sinoaortic nerves (buffer nerves) normally discharge rhythmically, synchronous with the pressure fluctuation during systole and diastole. They respond to BP changes between 70 mm Hg and 150 mm Hg. When BP rises, baroreceptors are stimulated and their afferents (through sinoaortic nerves) stimulate nucleus of tractus solitarus (NTS) which inturn inhibits the pressor area of VMC, i.e., Rostral ventrolateral medula (RVLM). This results in decreased sympathetic outflow and therefore decreases in vasomotor tone and vasodilation. Vasodilation brings down the BP. Thereby helping hemostasis. Activated NTS also stimulates nucleus ambiguous (cardioinhibitory center) of medulla, which increases parasympathetic (vagal) output, through vagus, that decreases heart rate. Reduction in heart rate reduces the cardiac output, which also reduces BP. Baroreceptor stimulation also weekly inhibits respiration, o When BP falls, for instance while changing the posture from lying down to standing, reverse change takes place. When a person stands up, his blood is pooled in the veins of lowrer limbs by the effect of gravity. Central venous pressure and venous return decrease, which causes a fall in stroke volume. Hence the systolic BP falls. As a result, the discharge rate of baroreceptors decreases leading to a decrease in the inhibitory' influence on the pressor area of VMC. Hence vasomotor tone increases, leading to vasoconstriction, and consequently an increase in BP. Simultaneously, the nucleus ambiguous of the vagus is also inhibited, increasing the heart rate and consequently stroke volume and eventually BP. Thus fall in BP due to change of posture is very brief (Transient).",general_faq
Intrinsic factor of castle is secreted by which of the following cells in gastric glands,,"The stomach also adds a significant volume of digestive juices to the meal. Like salivary secretion, the stomach actually readies itself to receive the meal before it is actually taken in, during the so-called cephalic phase that can be influenced by food preferences. The gastric secretions arise from glands in the wall of the stomach that drain into its lumen, and also from the surface cells that secrete primarily mucus and bicarbonate to protect the stomach from digesting itself, as well as substances known as trefoil peptides that stabilize the mucus-bicarbonate layer. The glandular secretions of the stomach differ in different regions of the organ. The most characteristic secretions derive from the glands in the fundus or body of the stomach. These contain two distinctive cell types from which the gastric secretions arise: the parietal cells, which secrete hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor; and the chief cells, which produce pepsinogens and gastric lipase. The acid secreted by parietal cells serves to sterilize the meal and also to begin the hydrolysis of dietary macromolecules. Intrinsic factor is impoant for the later absorption ofvitamin B12 or cobalamin. Pepsinogen is the precursor of pepsin, which initiates protein digestion. Lipase similarly begins the digestion of dietary fats.REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO:432",general_faq

The ratio of low to high molecular weight proteins in urine in various cases of syndrome is a manifestation of the selectivity of proteinuria. A highly selective proteinuria consists mostly of low molecular weight proteins, i.e. albumin & transferrin, where as apoorly selective proteinuria consists of higher molecular weight globulin in addition to albumin. Edema o Proteinuria leads to hypoalbuminemia that results in decreased colloid osmotic pressure edema.

Streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome was so named because of its similarity to staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome. The illness includes fever, hypotension, renal impairment, and the respiratory distress syndrome. It is usually caused by strains that produce exotoxin. It may be associated with localized infection as well; the most common associated infection is a soft tissue infection such as necrotizing fasciitis. The mortality is high (up to 30%), usually secondary to shock and respiratory failure. The rapid progression of the disease and its high mortality demand early recognition and aggressive treatment. Management includes fluid resuscitation, pressor agents, mechanical ventilation, antibodies, and, if necrotizing fasciitis is present, surgical debridement.",general_faq

"In a family, the father has widely spaced eyes, increased facial hair and deafness. One of the three children has deafness with similar facial features. The mother is normal. Which one of the following is most likely pattern of inheritance in this case?",,"A i.e. Autosomal dominant (most likely) Waardenburg's Syndrome (WS) is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by pigmentary disturbances (skin, hair, iris), sensorineural hearing loss, and other developmental anomalies such as dystopia canthorum (widely spaced eyes) and blepharophimosis. The syndrome that closest matches the features provided in the question is Waardeburg syndrome type-I. This is inherited as an autosomal dominant fashion and hence is the answer of exclusion. As the question does not provide us with details as to the sex of the three children, a sex linked inheritance pattern cannot be worked out. Also the combined presentation of an affected father, unaffected mother and one affected child among three children is possible with both an autosomal dominant and an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. In absence of any more details, the answer to this question cannot be deduced through the exploration of various permutations and combinations. How both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance can be responsible for the above combination: Autosomal Dominant Autosomal recessive (A-affected allele and a normal allele) If the disease is transmitted in an Autosomal Dominant then :Father (affected) will be either 'AA' or 'Aa' Mother (unaffected) will be 'aa' If father is AA and mother aa, the offsprings will be 1. aA - 100% affected If father is Aa and mother aa, the offsprings will Aa - 50% affected aa - 50% not affected The scenario in the above question therefore is possible autosomal dominant inheritance if father is Aa and mother is aa (A'-affected allele and 'a' normal allele) If the disease is transmitted in an Autosomal recessive form :Father (affected) will be 'AA' Mother (unaffected) may be 'aa' or 'Aa' If father is AA and mother aa, the offsprings will be 1. aA - 100% not affected, (but carriers) If father is AA and mother Aa, the offsprings will be Aa - 50% not affected, carrier AA - 50% affected The scenario in the above question therefore is possible with autosomal recessive inheritance if father is aa and mother is Aa",nutrition_advice

Diagnosis of carcinoid tumors is done by:,,Answer is A (5HIAA): The diagnosis of typical carcinoid tumors is done by measurement of 5HIAA levels. Diagnosis of Carcinoid Tumors (Harrison) The diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome relies on measurement of urinary or plasma serotonin or its metabolites in the urine. Typical carcinoid syndrome (high level of serotonin) is characterized by high levels of 5HIAA. The measurement of 5HIAA is most frequently used for typical carcinoid syndrome. Most physicians' only use urinary 5HIAA levels / excretion rates however plasma and platelets serotonin levels if available provide additional information. Platelet serotonin levels (5-HT) are more sensitive than urinary 5HIAA levels but are not generally available. Atypical carcinoid syndromes (low levels of serotonin) may have normal or minimally elevated 5HIAA levels. In such patient's urinary levels of other tryptophan metabolites such as 5HTP should be measured. Elevated levels of urinary 5 HTP is suggestive of an atypical carcinoid syndrome.,general_faq

Which of the following induction agent produce cardiac stability-,,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Etomidate Effects of Etomidate on cardiovascular systemEtomidate has minimal effects on the cardiovascular system.It causes mild reduction in peripheral vascular resistance which may cause a slight decline in arterial blood pressure.Myocardial contractility and cardiac output are usually unchanged. Etomidate does not release histamine. Cardiovascular effect of Propofol:The major cardiovascular effect of propofol is a decrease in arterial blood pressure due to a drop in systemic vascular resistance (inhibition of sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity, cardiac contractility and preload).Propofol markedly impairs the normal arterial baroreflex response to hypotension. Sometimes there may be a marked drop in preload.Cardiovascular effect of barbiturates (Thiopental)The cardiovascular effect of barbiturates vary markedly depending on the volume status, bas line autonomic tone and preexisting cardiovascular disease.Normally, intravenously administered barbiturates cause a fall in blood pressure.Cardiac output is maintained due to increase in heart rate and increased myocardial contractility from compensatory baroreceptor reflexes.However, in the absence of adequate baroreceptor response (e.g., hypovolemia, congestive heart failure, b adrenergic blockade) cardiac output and arterial blood pressure may fall dramatically due to uncompensated pooling and unmasked direct myocardial depression.Effect of ketamine on cardiovascular systemKetamine causes central stimulation of sympathetic system which causes increased arterial blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac output. There is also increase in pulmonary artery pressure and myocardial work.Because of these effects, ketamine should be avoided in patients with coronary artery disease, uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure and arterial aneurysms.",general_faq

A patient present with lower gastrointestinal bleed. Sigmoidoscopy shows ulcers inthe sigmoid. Biopsy from this area shows flask-shaped ulcers. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment -,,"This may be caused by haemorrhage from the colon, anal canal or small bowel. It is useful to distinguish those patients who present with profuse, acute bleeding from those who present with chronic or subacute bleeding of lesser severity .Severe acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding .This presents with profuse red or maroon diarrhoea and with shock. Diveicular disease is the most common cause and is often due to erosion of an aery within the mouth of a diveiculum. Bleeding almost always stops spontaneously, but if it does not, the diseased segment of colon should be resected after confirmation of the site by angiography or colonoscopy. Angiodysplasia is a disease of the elderly, in which vascular malformations develop in the proximal colon. Bleeding can be acute and profuse; it usually stops spontaneously but commonly recurs. Diagnosis is often difficult. Colonoscopy may reveal characteristic vascular spots and, in the acute phase, visceral angiography can show bleeding into the intestinal lumen and an abnormal large, draining vein. In some patients, diagnosis is achieved only by laparotomy with on-table colonoscopy. The treatment of choice is endoscopic thermal ablation but resection of the affected bowel may be required if bleeding continues. Bowel ischaemia due to occlusion of the inferior mesenteric aery can present with abdominal colic and rectal bleeding. It should be considered in patients (paicularly the elderly) who have evidence of generalised atherosclerosis. The diagnosis is made at colonoscopy. Resection is required only in the presence of peritonitis. Meckel's diveiculum with ectopic gastric epithelium may ulcerate and erode into a major aery. The diagnosis should be considered in children or adolescents who present with profuse or recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding. A Meckel's 99mTc-peechnetate scan is sometimes positive but the diagnosis is commonly made only by laparotomy, at which time the diveiculum is excised Primary prevention of variceal bleeding If non-bleeding varices are identified at endoscopy, b-adrenoceptor antagonist (b-blocker) therapy with propranolol (80-160 mg/day) or nadolol (40-240 mg/day) is effective in reducing poal venous pressure. Administration of these drugs at doses that reduce the hea rate by 25% has been shown to be effective in the primary prevention of variceal bleeding. In patients with cirrhosis, treatment with propranolol reduces variceal bleeding by 47% (number needed to treat for benefit (NNTB) 10), death from bleeding by 45% (NNTB 25) and overall moality by 22% (NNTB 16). The efficacy of b-blockers in primary prevention is similar to that of prophylactic banding, which may also be considered, paicularly in patients who are unable to tolerate or adhere to b-blocker therapy. Carvedilol, a non-cardioselective vasodilating b-blocker, is also effective and may be better tolerated at doses of 6.25-12.5 mg/day).

Rates above 5 L/min can result in discomfo to the patient, drying of the nasal passages, and possibly nose bleeds (epistaxis). Also with flow rates above 6 L/min, the laminar flow becomes turbulent and the oxygen therapy being delivered is only as effective as delivering 5-6 L/min. The nasal cannula is often used in elderly patients or patients who can benefit from oxygen therapy but do not require it to self respirate.

Normal serum level - less than 4 mg/ml 4 - 10 mg/ml - this range is common for both BHP and Ca. More than 10 mg/ml - approx 75% will have cancer. Since PSA is not specific for Ca, PSA Velocity & PSA density is used to detect Prostate cancer. PSA velocity is the rate of change in PSA levels over time and is expressed most commonly as the PSA doubling time. For men with a PSA above 4, PSA velocity of more than .75 mg/ml year is suggestive of Ca. While for those with lower PSA levels, rates above 0.5 mg/ml, per year should be used to advise biopsy. PSA density is calculated by dividing the serum PSA by the estimated prostate weight (measured by TRUS). It was developed to correct for the contribution of BPH to the total PSA level. Values < 0.10 are consistent with BPH. > 0.15 suggest cancer Ref : Bailey & Love 25/e p1356",symptoms_diagnosis

This allow time for DNA repair.b) DNA repair: p-53 also helps in DNA repair directly by inducing transcription of GADD 45 (growth arrest and DNA damage). GADD 45 encodes a protein that is involved in DNA repair.* If DNA damage is repaired successfully, p53 activate MDM-3 and this MDM-3 induce degradation of p-53 - Relieve in cell cycle block. If DNA damage cannot be successfully repaired, p53 induces apoptosis by inducing the activation of apoptosis inducing gene BAX. So p-53 prevents replication of cell with defective DNA - p53 functions as a critical gatekeeper against formation of cancer.

The advantage of using a tooth positioner as a retainer is :,,"The use of a tooth positioner rather than final settling archwires has two advantages: 

It allows the fixed appliance to be removed somewhat more quickly than otherwise would have been the case (i.e., some finishing that could have been done with the final archwires can be left to the positioner)
It serves not only to reposition the teeth but also to massage the gingiva, which is almost always at least slightly inflamed and swollen after comprehensive orthodontic treatment. The gingival stimulation provided by a positioner is an excellent way to promote a rapid return to normal gingival contours.

As a general rule, a tooth positioner in a cooperative patient will produce any changes it is capable of within 2-3 weeks. Final (post-treatment) records and retainer impressions can be taken 2 or 3 weeks after the positioner is placed. Beyond that time, if the positioner is continued, it is serving as a retainer rather than a finishing device-and positioners, as a rule, are not good retainers.

Use of high inspiratory flow rate can minimize end inspiratory lung volume and intrinsic PEEP, but it can cause higher peak airway pressures. Volume cycled assist control mode of ventilation is the most commonly used mode of ventilation. Volume targeted modes deliver a preset volume unless a specified circuit pressure limit is exceeded. Its major advantages are capacity to deliver unvarying tidal volumes, flexibility of flow and volume adjustments, and power to ventilate difficult patients. Disadvantages of this type of ventilation are: Unless the airway is well sealed volume cycled modes cannot ventilate effectively and consistently. After the flow rate and profile are set the inflation time of machine is set and remains unresponsive to patients native cycling rythm and flow demands.

Xerophthalmia caused by a severe vitamin A deficiency is described by pathologic dryness of the conjunctiva and * cornea. The conjunctiva becomes dry, thick and wrinkled. If untreated, it can lead to corneal ulceration and ultimately to blindness as a result of corneal damage. Xerophthalmia is a term that usually implies a destructive dryness of the conjunctival epithelium due to dietary vitamin A deficiency -- a rare condition in developed countries, but still causing much damage in developing countries. Other forms of dry eye are associated with aging, poor lid closure, scarring from previous injury, or autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid ahritis and SjOgren's syndrome, and these can all cause chronic conjunctivitis. Radioiodine therapy can also induce xerophthalmia, often transiently Xerophthalmia from hypovitaminosis A is specifically due to lack of the hormone-like vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid Treatment can occur in two ways: treating symptoms and treating the deficiency. Treatment of symptoms usually includes use of aificial tears in the form of eye drops, increasing the humidity of the environment with humidifiers, and wearing wrap around glasses when outdoors. Treatment of the deficiency can be accomplished with a Vitamin A or multivitamin supplement or by eating foods rich in Vitamin A.

Because of its agonistic activity on opioid receptors it suppresses withdrawal symptoms. L-alpha-acetyl-methadol/ Levomethyl (LAAM) is the other opioid agonist which was used for this purpose. However it is no longer in use because some patients developed prolonged QT intervals (torsades de points).2. Substitution of partial agonist:- Buprenorphine can be used in place of methadone because of its partial agonistic activity on opioid receptor.3. Substitution by a2 agonists:- Clonidine acts as a sympatholytic agent due to its agonistic action on central presynaptic a2 receptors which reduce nor-adrenergic activity. Therefore, clonidine reduces the adrenergic withdrawal symptoms. Lofexidine another a2 agonist, is an alternative to clonidine.4. Clonidine plus naltrexone:- A more rapid detoxification can occur when clonidine is used along with naltrexone. Naltrexone, when given in opioid dependent patient, causes withdrawal symptoms because of its antagonistic action. These can be treated with clonidine. The addition of short acting Benzodiazepine (lorazepam or oxazepam) and NSAIDs, will help relieve withdrawl symptoms not covered by clonidine. It should be kept in mind that naltrexone should not be used alone for detoxification (to treat withdrawl syptoms) as it precipitates or worsens the withdrawl syndrome.5. Other drugs:- Dextropropoxyphene, diphenoxylateb) M aintenance therapyo Once detoxification phase is over (i.e., withdrawal symptoms have been managed), the patient is maintained on any of the following drugs to prevent relapse by reducing craving and preventing 'kick' or 'euphoria' produced by opioids (morphine or heroin). Drugs used are:-1. Methadone:- Reduces craving and 'kick/euphoria' from morphine or heroin because their opioid receptors are already occupied.2. LAAM and buprenorphine:- Similarly reduce craving.3. Opioid antagonists (naltrexone):- Naltrexone can be used orally to assist in the rehabilitation of exopioid abusers who are fully withdrawn (otherwise it induces an acute withdrawl syndrome). Naltrexone prevents relapse by discouraging substance seeking behavior - If a patient, who is on naltrexone maintenance therapy, takes an opioid, there is no 'kick' or 'euphoria' as opioid receptors are already blocked. Naltrexone can be used with clonidine as in detoxification.",nutrition_advice

Physical examination is remarkable for swelling and erythema of the right great toe as well as small nodules on the patient's external ear. Aspiration of the metatarsal-phalangeal joint of the affected toe demonstrates needle-shaped negatively birefringent crystals. Which of the following agents would provide the most immediate relief for this patient?",,"The patient has gout, which is due to precipitation of monosodium urate crystals in joint spaces (notably the great toe) and soft tissues (causing tophi, which are often found on the external ears). Colchicine reduces the inflammation caused by the urate crystals by inhibiting leukocyte migration and phagocytosis secondary to an effect on microtubule assembly. Allopurinol and its metabolite, oxypurinol, inhibit xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that forms uric acid from hypoxanthine. Therapy with this agent should be begun 1-2 weeks after the acute attack has subsided. Aspirin competes with uric acid for tubular secretion, thereby decreasing urinary urate excretion and raising serum uric acid levels. At high doses (more than 2 gm daily) aspirin is a uricosuric.

Platelet aggregation is blocked by aspirin due to its action on:,,"Ans. c. Thromboxane A2 (Ref: Goodman Gilman 12/e p868; Katzung 12/e p638; KDT 7/e p195, 6/e p186, 609)Aspirin causes several different effects in the body, mainly the reduction of inflammation, analgesia, the prevention of clotting, and the reduction of fever. Much of this is believed to be due to decreased production of prostaglandins and TXA2.""In platelets, the major cyclooxygenase product is TxA2 (thromboxane A 2), a labile inducer of platelet aggregation and a potent vasoconstrictor. Aspirin blocks production of TxA2 by acetylating a serine residue near the active site of platelet cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), the enzyme that produces the cyclic endoperoxide precursor of TxA2. Because platelets do not synthesize new proteins, the action of aspirin on platelet COX-1 is permanent, lasting for the life of the platelet (7-10 days).

And because the partial pressure of a gas is determined by the soluble fraction of gas and not by the amount carried chemically bound to hemoglobin - the Hb does not determine P02 and hypoxemia does not depend on Hb level.
In CO poisoning effective hemoglobin that can carry O2 decreases (because CO occupies Hb binding site) since P02 or arterial blood O2 remains normal, peripheral chemoreceptors are not stimulated and hyperventilation is not seen.
 In hypoxia, with the reduction of PO2 cerebral blood flow increases (d/t vaso dilatation)to maintain O2 delivery in the brain.
The cerebral cortex can tolerate acute hypoxia for 5-10 min at 28°C, 20 min at 20°C, and 50 min at 50°C.

Not true about post-transcriptional modification of RNA-,,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Glycosyiution.m-RNA processingo Prokaryotic mRNA is functional immediately upon synthesis, i.e. prokaryotic primary transcript of mRNA is functional. Thus it does not require post-transcriptional modification. In Eukaryotes the primary transcript of mRNA is the hn RNA (hetrogeneous nuclear RNA). After transcription hnRNA is extensively modified to form functional mRNA. These modifications are as follows.The 51-cappingThis is the first processing reaction. 5l-end of mRNA is capped with 7-methylguansosine. This cap helps in initiation of translation (protein synthesis) and stabilizes the structure of mRNA by protecting from 5'-exonuclease.Addition of poly 'A' tail As the name suggests, multiple4A' (adenylate) residues are added at 31 end.This poly-A tail is not transcribed from DNA. but rather added after transcription. These tails helps to stabilize the mRNA (by protecting from 31-exonuclease), facilitate exit from the nucleus, and aid in translation. After mRNA enters the cytosol, the poly-A tail is gradually shortened. Some mRNAs do not have poly-A tail, e.g. mRNAs of histones and some interferons.Removal of introns (splicing) Eukaryotic genes contain some coding sequences which code for protein and some intervening non-coding sequences which do not code for protein. The coding sequences are called 'exons'and intervening non-coding sequences are called 'introns'. The process by which introns are excised and exons are linked to form functional mRNA is called splicing. Thus mature mRNA does not contain introns.# Spitcesome :- Splicesome is an assembly made up of small nuclear RNA (snRNA), some proteins and hnRNA. snRNA combines with proteins to form small nuclear ribnonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs or snurps) that mediate splicing. It is snRNA component of snurps that catalyzes splicing. Snurps are U1, U2, U3, U4, U5 and U6-o Only about 1[?]5% of human DNA has coding sequence (exons). Remaining is non-coding (introns).Alternate splicing :- The hn-RNA molecules from some genes can be spliced in alternative way in different tissues. Thus two or more different mRNA (and therefore 2 or more proteins) can be synthesized from same hnRNA. For example, difference isoforms of tropomyosin in different tissues in due to alternate splicing.",general_faq

Regarding glutathione which of the following is/are true:,,"Ans:C.)It helps in membrane transpo. GLUTATHIONE: Glutathione is a tripeptide made up of glutamate, cysteine and glycine (T-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine). Glutathione is present in all mammalian cells except neurons. The sulphydryl (-SH) group of cysteine residue is the reactive poion of glutathione which can undergo oxidation and reduction. Thus, glutathione may exist as the reduced (G-SH) or oxidized form (G-S-S-G) and can play a role in some oxidation-reduction reactions. In oxidized form two molecules of glutathione are linked by disulfide bond. Cysteine in glutathione act as reducing agent FUNCTIONS : - It helps in keeping some enzyme in active state by preventing the oxidation of sulphydryl (-SH) group of enzyme. It helps in detoxification of H2O2 by reducing it. Superoxide anion (O2) first conveed to H2O2 by superoxide dismutase. Glutathione helps in membrane transpo H2O2 is then reduced to H2O2 by glutathione perioxidase, a reaction requires reduced glutathione. Thus, glutathione scavenges free radicals and superoxide anion. It helps in detoxification of xenobiotics by their conjugation (conjugation reaction). Reduced form of glutathione (GSH) with a free sulphydryl (-SH) group serves as a redox buffer, regulating redox state of the cell. Reduced glutathione is essential for maintaining the normal structure of RBCs and for keeping hemoglobin iron in ferrous state (prevents formation of methemoglobin). It is involved in the transpo of amino acids across the cell membane of kidney and intestine.",general_faq

Chronotrophic means: March 2010,,"Ans. B: Drugs affecting hea rate Chronotropic effects are those drugs that change the hea rate. Chronotropic drugs may change the hea rate by affecting the nerves controlling the hea, or by changing the rhythm produced by the sinoatrial node. Positive chronotropes increase hea rate; negative chronotropes decrease hea rate. A dromotrope affects Atrioventricular node (AV node) conduction. A positive dromotrope increases AV nodal conduction, and a negative dromotrope decreases AV nodal conduction. A lusitrope is an agent that affects diastolic relaxation. Inotropes affects contractility of the hea. Chronotropic variables in systolic myocardial performance can be split left and right. Left sided systolic chronotropy can be appreciated as Aoic Valve open to close time. Right sided variables are represented by Pulmonary valve open to close time.

The following statements are true regarding Chlamydia except:,,"Unique properties of Chlamydia are
Chlamydia is an obligate intracellular parasite. This means they can survive only by establishing residence inside
Animal cells
They need their host's ATP as an energy source for their own cellular activity. They are energy parasites using a
Cell membrane transport system that uses ATP from the host system and gives out ADP.
This obligate intracellular existence makes it impossible to culture these organisms on nonliving artibacterial media.
Due to their small size and failure to grow in cell - free media they were considered to be viruses.
Chlamydiae grows in cultures of a variety of eukaryotic cell lines Me Coy or HeLa cells. It may be necessary to
Treat cells with poly anionic compounds such as DEAD-dextran to reduce the electrostatic barrier to infection.
Antimetabolite such as cycloheximide is added to favour competition for host cell amino acid pools. All types of
Chlamydiae proliferate in embryonated eggs particularly in the yolk sac.
The special features in structure and chemical composition of chlamydiae are
The outer cell wall resembles the cell wall of gram negative bacteria It has a relatively high lipid content
It is rigid but it does not contain typical bacterial peptidoglycan; perhaps it contains a Tetrapeptide linked matrix.
N Acetyl muramic acid also appears to be absent from chlamydiae cell wall
Antibiotic susceptibility of chlamydiae.
Penicillin binding proteins occur in chlamydiae cell wall and chlamydiae cell wall formation is inhibited by penicillins
And other drugs that inhibit transpeptidation of bacterial peptidoglycan. But remember the important point about t/t,
That cell wall inhibitors result in the production of morphologically defective forms but are not effective in clinical
Disease.
• Inhibitors of protein synthesis (tetracyclines, erythromycins) are effective in most clinical infections. Erythromycin
Or tetracyclines are considered the drug of choice for chlamydiae infections.",general_faq

A 62 year old man has a 25 year history of alcoholism and liver disease. He visits his physician complaining of pain and swelling of his legs. A decrease in which of the following is the most likely cause of the peripheral edema?,,"The plasma colloid osmotic pressure is often low in alcoholics with chronic liver disease (cirrhosis). The diseased liver cannot produce adequate amounts of albumin, which leads to a decrease in the concentration of albumin in the plasma, i.e., hypoalbuminemia. Because about 75% of the plasma colloid osmotic pressure can be attributed to the presence of albumin in the plasma, the decrease in plasma albumin concentration that occurs in the latter stages of cirrhosis often leads to peripheral edema. Cirrhosis also causes excess fluid to accumulate in the peritoneal cavity as ascites. In the case of ascites, the edema results not only from hypoalbuminemia, but also from poal vein obstruction (which increases capillary hydrostatic pressure) as well as the obstruction of lymphatic drainage of the liver. In fact, ascites is observed more often than peripheral edema in liver disease. A decrease in capillary hydrostatic pressure would tend to decrease fluid loss from the capillaries, and thereby oppose the development of edema. A decrease in the colloid osmotic pressure of the interstitial fluid would decrease fluid loss from the capillaries, thereby opposing the development of edema. A decrease in interstitial hydrostatic pressure would tend to increase fluid loss from the capillaries, but this cannot be considered a primary cause of edema because the interstitial hydrostatic pressure actually increases when a tissue becomes edematous.

"All of the following are true about OPSI (Overwhelming Postsplenectomy Infection), Except:",,"Ans is A (Maximum risk is within 1 year of splenectomy) Overwhelming Postsplenectomy Infection (OPSI) Splenectomised patients are likely to suffer from severe infections. This syndrome is called overwhelming postsplenectomy infection (OPSI). OPSI is among the more devastating sequelae of asplenia and is the most common fatal late complication of splenectomy. The loss of the spleen's ability to filter and phagocytose bacteria and parasitized blood cells predisposes the patient to infection by encapsulated bacteria or parasites. Splenectomy also results in the loss of a significant source of antibody production. Infection may occur at any time after splenectomy; in one recent series, most infections occurred more than 2 years after splenectomy, and 42% occurred more than 5 years after splenectomy.""- Sabiston I8/e The risk for OPSI is greater after splenectomy for malignancy or hematologic disease than for trauma. The risk also appears to be greater in young children (<4 years of age). OPSI may begin with a relatively mild-appearing prodrome, including fever, malaise, myalgias, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. These symptoms may then progress rapidly to fulminant bacteremic septic shock, with accompanying hypotension, anuria, disseminated intravascular coagulation, coma, and death within hours of presentation. The moality rate is between 50% and 70% for fully developed OPSI despite antibiotics and intensive care. Survivors often have a long and complicated hospital course with severe sequelae, such as peripheral gangrene requiring amputation, deafness from meningitis, mastoid osteomyelitis, bacterial endocarditis, and cardiac valvular destruction. S. pneumoniae is the most frequently involved organism in OPSI and is estimated to be responsible for between 50% and 90% of cases. Other organisms involved in OPSI include Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus species and other pneumococcal species, Salmonella species, and Capnocytophaga canimorsus (implicated in OPSI as a sequela of dog bites). Currently, the standard of care for postsplenectomy patients includes immunization within 2 weeks of splenectomy with: - polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine (PPV23), - H. influenzae type b conjugate, and - meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine Antibiotic prophylaxis--usually a single daily dose of penicillin or amoxicillin--is recommended for asplenic children.

Which is the only living pa of Hydatid cyst?,,"Hydatid cyst is caused by Echinococcus granulosus. It has a thick opaque white outer cuticle / laminated layer and an inner thin germinal layer containing nucleated cells. The germinal layer is the site of asexual reproduction. It also secretes the hydatid fluid which fills the cavity. The fluid is clear, colourless / pale yellow with a pH of 6.7 containing salts and protein. It is a good antigen which sensitises the host. The fluid was used as the antigen for Casoni's intradermal test and other diagnostic serological tests. From the germinal layer, small knob like excrescences / gemmules protrude into the lumen of the cyst. These enlarge and become vacuolated and filled with fluid. These are called brood capsules. They are initially attached to the germinal layer by a stalk, but later escapes free into the fluid filled cyst cavity. From the inner wall of brood capsule, protoscolices develop, which represent head of adult worm, complete with invaginated scolex, bearing suckers and hooklets. Each of these are potential tapeworm. Many of the scolices float free in the cyst fluid. These with free brood capsules are called hydatid sand. Ref: Paniker's Textbook of parasitology, 6th Ed page 151.",general_faq

"" - Khuran Ophthalmology 4/e p264 ""ROP is confined to those with a birth weight of under 1.5 kg and/or a gestational age of under 32 wks. ""- Parson 21/e P310 The hallmark of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is abnormal retinal vasculature. Ophthalmologists diagnose and make decisions about the initial treatment of ROP based on the appearance of the retinal blood vessels. Dilatation and tortuosity of the retinal vessels at the posterior pole is termed 'plus' disease. It is a sign of rapidly progressive ROP and is an indication for early laser ablation of the peripheral avascular retina.Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)ROP is a bilateral proliferative retinopathy that develops in premature infants due to incomplete vasculogenesis of retina at the time of birth.During normal retinal development, vessels migrate from the optic disc to the ora serrata beginning at 16weeks of gestation. Capillary network is formed differentiating into mature vessels which extend to nasal ora by 36 wks and tangential ora by 39-41 wks.The pathogenesis of ROP begins with premature birth. Exposure of extrauterine environment causes phases of hyperoxia-vasocessation (obliteration of retinal vessels) and hypoxia-Vaso proliferation (neovascularization). VEGF is thought to be the most important molecule involved in the neovascularization.Neovascularization leads to retinal and vitreous changes which ultimately lead to retinal detachment.Classification of ROP:ROP is described using a number of parameters. These are location of the disease into zones (1, 2, and 3), the circumferential extent of the disease based on the clock hours (1-12), the severity of the disease (stage 1-5) and the presence or absence of ""Plus Disease"".Classification on the basis of severity, ROP is divided into 5 stages:-Stage I- the first sign of ROP (stage 1) is the appearance of a thin, fiat, white structure (termed a demarcation line) at the junction of vascularized retina posteriorly and avascular retina anteriorly.Stage II- the demarcation line develops into a pink or white elevation (ridge) of thickened tissueStage III- proliferation of vessels over the ridge and into vitreous (extra vitreal fibrovascular proliferation)Stage IV- partial retinal detachmentIVa- partial detachment with macular sparing IVb- partial detachment with macula involvedStage V- total retinal detachmentClassification on basis of anatomical location:-Since there is a direct correlation between severity of disease and amount of avascular retina, the location of the border between vascularized and avascular retina is an important prognostic sign.3 zones are divided to describe the location of ROP. Location of the border in zone 1 is the most severe disease and in zone 3 least.Zone 1 is defined as a circle, the center of which is the disc, and the radius of which is twice the distance of the disc to the fovea.Zone 2 is a doughnut-shaped region that extends from the anterior border of Zone 1 to within one disc-diameter of the ora serrata nasally and to the anatomic equator temporally.Zone 3 encompasses the residual temporal retina.Plus disease:- As ROP progresses, more and more shunting occurs in the neovascular tissue at the retinal vascular- avascular junction. This increased retinal vascular blood flow results in dilation and tortuosity of the major retinal arteries and veins in the posterior pole - described as ""plus disease"". Plus disease is the hallmark of rapidly progressive ROP and is notated by adding a plus sign after the number of the ROP stage.Management:Most of the cases (approx. 80%) of ROP resolve spontaneously, hence intervention is chosen according to the below given protocol.ROP is divided into Threshold and Pre threshold disease.Threshold disease: It is defined as stage 3+ ROP in Zones 1 or 2 occupying at least five contiguous clock-hours or eight noncontiguous clock-hours of retina.Treatment of Threshold disease is - Laser photocoagulation.Pre threshold disease is divided into 2 types:High risk or Type I - treatment is Laser photocoagulationLow risk or Type II - treatment is Weekly or Twice weekly observationType 1 Pre thresholdType 2 Pre thresholdZone I ROP (any stage) + Zone I, Stage 3 Zone II, Stage 2/3 +Zone I, Stage 1/2 - Zone II, Stage 3 -Laser PhotocoagulationWeekly or Twice weekly observationROP diseases less severe than Pre threshold are followed up.In this question, the child with zone 1, stage II 'plus' ROP falls into Pre threshold disease- Type 1 or high risk type, hence Laser Photocoagulation would be the management of choice.",nutrition_advice

Increased osmotic fragility is characteristic of:September 2009,,"Ans. A: Hereditary spherocytosisThe normal red blood cell is a relatively impermeable biconcave disc which maintains osmotic equilibrium with the surrounding medium. As the surrounding medium becomes hypotonic, fluid will be taken into the cell to maintain stability. Eventually under very hypotonic conditions the cell will fill to capacity and rupture. Spherocytic red blood cells have a decreased capacity to expand, and will rupture in mildly hypotonic conditions that fail to lyse normal red cells. They thus exhibit increased osmotic fragility.Osmotic fragility is determined by measuring the degree of hemolysis in hypotonic saline solution. With the unincubated test, red cell osmotic fragility is considered to be increased if hemolysis occurs in a sodium chloride concentration > 0.5%. Although increased osmotic fragility is characteristically associated with hereditary spherocytosis, it may also be increased in other types of hemolytic anemia associated with the presence of spherocytes, paicularly auto-immune hemolytic anemia, and in hypernatermia (Na > 155 meq/L).Often the increased osmotic fragility in spherocytosis is limited to a small fraction of cells that are unusually susceptible to lysis. After incubation, the defect is magnified, and a striking increase in fragility will be seen in hereditary spherocytosis. Osmotic fragility is considered to be decreased if hemolysis is not complete in a 0.30% NaC1 solution. Decreased osmotic fragility is associated with chronic liver disease, iron deficiency anemia, thalassemia, hyponatremia (Na < 130 meq/ L), polycythemia vera, and sickle cell anemia after splenectomy.",general_faq

This antihistaminic drug is a weak base and will be highly ionized in the acidic urine. As ionized drugs cannot be reabsorbed in the nephron, urinary acidifying agents like NH4Cl will accelerate the excretion of this agent. On the other hand, NaHCO3 will decrease its excretion by increasing the unionized form. Blood pH is slightly alkaline (7.4) whereas gastric pH is highly acidic. Basic drugs are ionized more in the acidic pH, therefore option (c) is false.

Aetiology and pathogenesis
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a diffuse neutrophilic alveolitis caused by a range of conditions and characterised by bilateral radiographic inﬁltrates and hypoxaemia. Activated neutrophils are sequestered into the lungs and capillary permeability is increased, with damage to cells within the alveoli. The pathophysiology is part of the inﬂammatory spectrum, and the triggers are similar: infective and non-infective inﬂammatory processes. These processes result in exudation and accumulation of protein-rich cellular ﬂuid within alveoli and the formation of characteristic ‘hyaline membranes’. Local release of cytokines and chemokines by activated macrophages and neutrophils results in progressive recruitment of inﬂammatory cells. Secondary effects include loss of surfactant and impaired surfactant production. The net effect is alveolar collapse and reduced lung compliance, most marked in dependent regions of the lung (mainly dorsal in supine patients). 
The affected airspaces become ﬂuid-ﬁlled and can no longer contribute to ventilation, resulting in hypoxaemia (due to increased pulmonary shunt) and hypercapnia (due to inadequate ventilation in some areas of the lung): that is, ventilation–perfusion mismatch.

Malignant otitis externa (also k/a Necrotizing external otitis) Malignant otitis externa is an inflammatory condition of the external ear usually spreading deep to cause osteomyelitis of temporal bone and base of skull. It occurs primarily in immunocompromised persons, especially older persons with diabetes mellitus, and is often initiated by self-inflicted or iatrogenic trauma to the external auditory canal [May also be seen in pts. who received radiotherapy to skull base I The most frequent pathogen is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Others may be S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Aspergillus, Actinomyces, and some gram-negative bacterial. One of the hallmarkof malignant otitis externs is granulation tissue in the external auditory canal, especially at the hone-cailage junction. As the infection spreads to the temporal bone, it may extend into the cranium and result in cranial nerve palsies (commonly the facial nerve) Cranial nerve involvement indicates poor prognosis. Death is usually due to intracranial complications such as sigmoid sinus thrombosis. It has high moality rate due to which the name 'malignant' is used for this disease. Treatment Includes correction of immunosuppression (when possible), local treatment of the auditory canal, long-term systemic antibiotic therapy, and in selected patients, surgery. - In all cases, the external ear canal is cleansed and a biopsy specimen of the granulation tissue sent for culture. - IV antibiotics is directed against the offending organism. - For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common pathogen, the regimen involves an antipseudomonal penicillin or cephalosporin (3rd generation-piperacillin or ceftazidime) with an aminoglycoside. A fluoroquinolone antibiotic can be used in place of the aminoglycoside. Ear drops containing antipseudomonal antibiotic e.g. ciproflaxacin plus a glucocoticoid is also used. - Early cases can be managed with oral and otic fluoroquinolones only. - Extensive surgical debridement once an impoant pa of the treatment is now rarely needed.",nutrition_advice

Digoxin toxicity may be caused by drugs that increase serum digoxin levels or increase the binding of digoxin to its receptor, the sodium-potassium adenosine tn phosphatase (ATPase). Quinidine decreases digoxin volume of distribution and clearance. Verapamil also decreases the clearance of digoxin. Both drugs may
thereby increase serum digoxin levels and precipitate digoxin toxicity.

Which radiographic assessment should be done for this patient?",,"The American Dental Association (ADA), the American Academy for Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD), the European Academy for Pediatric Dentistry (EAPD), and other organizations have published criteria that are meant to guide the dental professional in decision-making regarding appropriate radiographic imaging (Table 2-5). These guidelines clearly state that if the patient cannot cope with the procedure, one should attempt other strategies to handle the situation. The guidelines all acknowledge that, in some cases, radiographs are not possible, in which case, one should balance the benefit against the risk even more carefully. Sometimes it is better to postpone the radiographic exposure until the patient is older or better conditioned. The guidelines also clearly state that if there are no clinical signs of pathology, the need for a radiographic assessment is up to the professional’s judgment, and that these decisions have to be made on an individual patient basis. Radiographs are never to be used for economic and screening reasons since they involve a potential health risk for the patient. A 3-year-old with a sound dentition and open proximal contacts does not need a radiographic assessment. In contrast, for a 3-year-old with only 10 teeth visible in the mouth and no history of dental treatment, the dental professional should make a radiographic assessment.

What is irregular astigmatism-,,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Non perpendicular principal meridians ASTIGMATISMo Astigmatism is a type of refractive error wherein the refraction varies in the different meridia. Consequently, the rays of light entering in the eye cannot converge to a point focus but form focal lines. The refractive error of the astigmatic eye stems from a difference in degree of curvature refraction of the two different meridians (i.e.,, the eye has different focal point in different planes). For example, the image may be clearly focused on retina in the horizontal plane, but not in the vertical plane.o The most common cause of astigmatism is abnormality of corneal curvature. Other less common causes are lenticular (curvature abnormality of lens,oblique position of lens) and retinal (oblique placement of macula). Types of astigmatismBased on axis of the principal meridiansRegular stigmatism : Principal meridians are perpendicularo With-the-rule astigmatism-the vertical meridian is steepest.o Against-the-rule astigmatism-the horizontal meridian is steepest.o Oblique astigmatism-the steepest curve lies in between 120 and 150 degrees and 30 and 60 degrees.Irregular astigmatism - principal meridians are not perpendicular.Based on focus of the principal meridiansSimple astigmatismo Simple hyperopic astigmatism - first focal line is on retina while the second is located behind the retinao Simple myopic astigmatism - first focal line is in front of the retina while the second is on the retina.Compound astigmatismo Compound hyperopic astigmatism-both focal lines are located behind the retina,o Compound myopic astigmatism-both focal lines are located in front of the retina.Mixed astigmatism-focal lines are on both sides of the retina (straddling the retina).Treatment of Astigmatismo Treatment of astigmatism consists : -Optical treatment: - It consists of cylindrical power spectacles or contact lens.

The relative youthfulness of the patient often rules out prostatic enlargement, which characteristically occurs after the age of 50. As the stream becomes narrower, micturition is prolonged and is followed by postmicturition dribbling as a result of urine trickling from the dilated urethra proximal to the stricture. Urinary frequency by day and night is common and is due to incomplete bladder emptying, coexisting detrusor overactivity or urinary infection. If the stricture is tight enough, the patient will go into acute retention, although this is rare. If this happens, there is a danger that clumsy attempts to pass a urethral catheter will result in a false passage. If a patient has gone into retention because of a urethral stricture, its lumen will be too narrow to pass even a tiny catheter and suprapubic catheterisation is required. Investigation involves uroflowmetry, urethroscopy, urethrography and ultrasound scanning to assess bladder emptying and to detect any upper tract dilatation. The urinary flow rate is typically prolonged and plateau shaped while urethroscopy allows the stricture to be viewedas a circumferential scar. Openings of false passages commemorate previous misguided attempts to pass a urethral catheter.

One theory is that scar tissue blocks lymphatic drainage, causing an increased concentration of anthracotic pigment-containing carcinogens. Persistent hyperplasia of tissue and the potential for a mutation leading to cancer are other mechanisms that may be similar to those of cancers that develop in fistulous tracts draining pus (e.g., chronic osteomyelitis).",general_faq

All are hepatotoxic except,,"Isoflurane is metabolized to trifluoroacetic acid. Although serum fluoride fluid levels may rise, nephrotoxicity is extremely unlikely, even in the presence of enzyme inducers. Prolonged sedation (>24 h at 0.1-0.6% isoflurane) of critically ill patients has resulted in elevated plasma fluoride levels (15-50 mmol/L) without evidence of kidney impairment. Similarly, up to 20 MAC-hours of isoflurane may lead to fluoride levels exceeding 50 mmol/L without detectable postoperative kidney dysfunction. Its limited oxidative metabolism also minimizes any possible risk of significant hepatic dysfunction. Total hepatic blood flow (hepatic aery and poal vein flow) may be reduced during isoflurane anesthesia. Hepatic oxygen supply is better-maintained with isoflurane than with halothane, however, because hepatic aery perfusion is preserved. Liver function tests are usually not affected.

A 22-year-old African American male wants to know if he has sickle cell trait. He has no previous history of the signs or symptoms of sickle cell anemia. What laboratory method or test can be used to detect the presence of hemoglobin S?,,"The metabisulfite test is used to detect the presence of hemoglobin S, but it does not differentiate the heterozygous sickle cell trait from the homozygous sickle cell disease. The test is based on the fact that erythrocytes with a large propoion of hemoglobin S sickle in solutions of low oxygen content. Metabisulfite is a reducing substance that enhances the process of deoxygenation. The osmotic fragility test is a diagnostic test for hereditary spherocytosis. Spherocytes lyse at a higher concentration of salt than do normal cells, thus causing an increased osmotic fragility. The direct antiglobulin test (DAT), or Coombs' test, is used to differentiate autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) due to the presence of anti-red cell antibodies from other forms of hemolytic anemia. In this test, antibodies to human immunoglobulin cause the agglutination (clotting) of red cells if these anti-red cell antibodies are present on the surface of the red cells. In patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, the erythrocytes are excessively sensitive to complement-mediated lysis in low ionic environments (the basis for the sucrose hemolysis test) or in acidotic conditions, such as sleep, exercise, or the Ham's acid hemolysis test. The Schilling test, which measures intestinal absorption of vitamin B12 with and without intrinsic factor, is used to diagnose decreased vitamin B12 caused by pernicious anemia, which is characterized by a lack of intrinsic factor.

Hypocalcemia with hyperphosphatemia are seen in.,,"<p>Improved medical management of chronic kidney disease now allows many patients to survive for decades and hence time enough to develop features of renal osteodystrophy, which must be controlled to avoid additional morbidity. Impaired production of 1,25(OH) 2 D is now thought to be the principal factor that causes calcium deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and bone disease; hyperphosphatemia typically occurs only in the later stages of CKD. Low levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D due to increased FGF23 production in bone are critical in the development of hypocalcemia. The uremic state also causes impairment of intestinal absorption by mechanisms other than defects in vitamin D metabolism. Nonetheless, treatment with supraphysiologic amounts of vitamin D or calcitriol corrects the impaired calcium absorption. Since increased FGF23 levels are seen even in early stages of renal failure in some patients, and have been repoed to correlate with increased moality, there is current interest in methods (lowering phosphate absorption) to lower FGF23 levels and concern as to whether vitamin D supplementation (known physiologically to increase FGF23) increases FGF23 in CKD. Hyperphosphatemia in renal failure lowers blood calcium levels by several mechanisms, including extraosseous deposition of calcium and phosphate, impairment of the bone-resorbing action of PTH, and reduction in 1,25(OH) 2 D production by remaining renal tissue(harrison 18 pg 3116)</p>",general_faq
The specific name of the anomaly shown in the following radiograph is:,,"Dens in Dente 
(Dens invaginatus, dilated composite odontome)
The  ‘dens in dente’  is a  developmental variation which is thought to arise as a result of an invagination in the surface of tooth crown before calcification has occurred. Several causes of this condition have been proposed. These include increased localized external pressure, focal growth retardation, and focal growth stimulation in certain areas of the tooth bud. The permanent maxillary lateral incisors are the teeth most frequently involved,  and in the majority of cases the  ‘dens in dente’ appears to represent simply an accentuation in the development of the lingual pit.
Radiological signs
Dens in dente represent a tooth-shaped, enamel-covered mass within the crown and/or root of the tooth but which may traverse the length of the tooth. Dilated odontome represents the most extreme form of this anomaly and exhibits a grossly altered morphology that is internally outlined by a dense linear radiopacity.

An upper motor neuron (UMN) lesion involving cranial nerve VII would most likely produce,,"The physical finding of facial asymmetry is suggestive of an abnormality involving the facial nerve (CN VII). The facial nucleus, which is located within the pons, is divided in half, the upper neurons innervate the upper muscles of the face, while the lower neurons innervate the lower poion of the face. It is impoant to realize that each half receives input from the contralateral motor coex, while only the upper half receives input from the ipsilateral motor coex. Therefore an upper motor neuron (UMN) lesion will produce a defect involving only the contralateral lower half of the face. Causes of UMN lesions involving the facial nerve includes strokes that involve the coex or the internal capsule. In contrast, lesions that affect the facial nerve from the facial nucleus to the remaining length of the nerve result in LMN lesions. Patients present with facial asymmetry involving the ipsilateral upper and lower quadrants. Lesions to the facial nerve within the facial canal (frequently due to cold weather) cause Bell's palsy. Patients present with paralysis of all muscles of facial expression. Bell's phenomenon refers to the finding of the affected eye looking up and out when patients try to close their eyes.

Three of these codons do not code for any specific amino acid (known as nonsense codons) and are used as termination signals (hence also known as termination or stop codons. When one of these termination codons appear in an mRNA sequence, it signals that polymerization of amino acids into a protein molecule is complete.Characteristics of the Genetic CodeSpecific or UnambiguousA given codon designates only one single specific amino acid.Degenerate or RedundantAlthough each codon corresponds to a single amino acid, a given amino acid may have more than one triplet coding for it.Exceptions are Methionine & Tryptophan, which have a single codon.Codons that represent same amino acids are called as synonymsIn general, the third nucleotide in a codon is less important than the first two in determining the specific amino acid. This is k/a third base degeneracy or wobbling phenomenon.UniversalIn all living organisms the genetic code is the same, this is k/a universality of the codeException is found in mitochondrial genome where AUA codes for methionine and UGA for tryptophan instead of isoleucine and termination respectively.Non-overlappingThere is no overlapping i.e. no base functions as a common member of two consecutive codons.CommalessThere is no punctuation between the codons. The codons are arranged as a continuous structure. The last nucleotide of the preceding codon is immediately followed by the first nucleotide of succeeding codon.",general_faq

In carcinoma cheek what is the best drug for single drug chemotherapy,,"Single-agent chemotherapy is used as palliative therapy in head and neck cancers with the recurrent or metastatic form of cancer. The drugs which are used are - Cisplatin Methotrexate 5 Fu Paclitaxel Docetaxel Sometimes combinations of these drugs are used . a) Treatment of localized head and neck cancers - These tumors are treated with curative intent either with surgery or radiotherapy. The choice of modality differs according to anatomic location and institutional expeise. In early laryngeal cancer generally, radiotherapy is done to preserve voice while in early oral cavity cancers, surgery is preferred to avoid the long-term complication of radiation such as xerostomia and dental decay. b) Locally or advanced regional disease - Combined modality therapy including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy is used. Concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy appear to be most effective. c) Recurrent or metastatic disease - chemotherapy is used. Management of neck lymph nodes The neck lymph nodes should be treated when there are clinically positive nodes or the risk for occult disease is high based on the location and stage of the primary lesion. The decision to perform neck dissection or irradiate the neck is related to the treatment of the primary lesion. If the primary tumor is being treated with radiation and the neck is N0 or N1, the nodes are usually treated with irradiation. For surgically treated primary lesions, N0 or N1 neck disease may be treated surgically as well (Radical neck dissection/Modified neck dissection/Selective neck dissection). Negative prognostic factors such as extracapsular spread of tumor, perineural invasion, vascular invasion, fixation to surrounding structures, and multiple positive nodes are indicators for postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy. For N2 or N3 neck disease, neck dissection with planned postoperative radiation therapy is performed.",medicine_info

Metastasis to the liver and beyond may give rise to the carcinoid syndrome. The tumors cause an intense desmoplastic reaction. Spread into the serosal lymphatics does not imply metastatic disease; local resection is potentially curative. When metastatic lesions are found in the liver, they should be resected when technically feasible to limit the symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome. When extensive hepatic metastases are found, the disease is not curable.

What is the pathology of edema in nephrotic syndrome,,"Ans. b. Sodium and water retention Sodium and water retention is the pathology of edema in nephrotic syndrome. The nephrotic syndrome is characterized by proteinuria, edema, and hypoalbuminemia. Renal sodium retention and changes in variables of the Starling equation are fundamental to the pathophysiology of nephrotic edema. There is evidence for both intravascular volume expansion (overfilling) and intravascular volume depletion (under filling) in patients with nephrosis. Microvascular fluid exchange is described using a formulation of the Starling driving forces (DP and Dp) and it is through this equation that nephrotic edema is conceptualized. Previous theories have focused on abnormalities in DP and Dp to explain nephrotic edema. Studies have shown that hypoalbuminemia (and thus Dp) is not a likely cause of edema formation in most nephrotic patients owing to a parallel decrease in interstitial fluid albumin and an increase in interstitial fluid pressure, both of which serve to maintain edema driving forces constant. There is limited evidence suggesting that abnormalities in vascular permeability (Kf and s) may contribute to edema formation. A major advance in our understanding of the pathophysiologic basis of edema formation in the nephrotic syndrome is the discovery that proteinuria can cause primary renal sodium retention through ENaC activation. This mechanism is likely active in all patients with nephrotic syndrome, regardless of their intravascular volume status. Other causes of primary renal sodium retention include increased renal efferent sympathetic nerve activity, ANPase, and in the expression and activity of the Ne--le in the collecting duct in animal models. Fuhermore, excess serum vasopressin levels have been found to contribute to free water retention in some patients with the nephrotic syndrome.""- Eric Siddall and Jai Radhakrishnan.

"Autopsy of a specimen shows pale infarction. Pale infarct is seen in all of the following organs, EXCEPT:",,"Classification of Infarcts: Pale (white, anemic) infarcts: They occur as a result of aerial obstruction in solid organs such as the hea, kidney, spleen, and brain that lack significant collateral circulation. The continuing venous drainage of blood from the ischemic tissue accounts for the pallor of such infarcts. Red (or hemorrhagic) infarcts: They found in tissues that have a double blood supply--eg, lung and liver--or in tissues such as intestine that have collateral vessels permitting some continued flow into the area although the amount is not sufficient to prevent infarction. The infarct is red because of extravasation of blood in the infarcted area from necrotic small vessels. Red infarcts may also occur in tissue if dissolution or fragmentation of the occluding thrombus permits reestablishment of aerial flow to the infarcted area. Venous infarcts are always associated with congestion and hemorrhage. They are red infarcts. Ref: Chandrasoma P., Taylor C.R. (1998). Chapter 9. Abnormalities of Blood Supply. In P. Chandrasoma, C.R.

The condition was named after the yellowish (ocher-like) discoloration of the tissue seen on microscopic examination. However, macroscopically the affected tissues appear bluish grey because of a light scattering phenomenon known as the Tyndall effect. The condition is most often associated with alkaptonuria but can occur from exogenous administration of phenol complexes like hydroquinone.Alkaptonuria (black urine disease or alcaptonuria) is a rare inherited genetic disorder of phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism. This is an autosomal recessive condition that is due to a defect in the enzyme homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase, which participates in the degradation of tyrosine. As a result, a toxic tyrosine byproduct called homogentisic acid (or alkapton) accumulates in the blood and is excreted in urine in large amounts (hence -uria)",general_faq

The antimicrobial agent which inhibits the ergosterol biosynthesis is:,,"IMIDAZOLES AND TRIAZOLES: These are presently the most extensively used antifungal drugs. Four irnidazoles are entirely topical, while ketoconazole is used both orally and topically. Two triazoles fluconazole and itraconazole have largely replaced ketoconazole for systemic mycosis because of greater efficacy, longer tlh, fewer side effects and drug interactions. The imidazoles and triazoles have broadspectrum antifungal activity covering dermatophytes, Candida, other fungi involved in deep mycosis (except mucor), Nocardia, some grampositive and anaerobic bacteria, e.g. Staph. aureus, Strep. faecal is, Bac. fragilis and Leishmania. The mechanism of action of irnidazoles and triazoles is the same. They inhibit the fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme &;lanosterol l4--demethylase&; and thus impair ergosterol synthesis leading to a cascade of membrane abnormalities in the fungus. The lower host toxicity of triazoles compared to irnidazoles has correlated with their lower affinity for mammalian CYP450 enzymes and lesser propensity to inhibit mammalian sterol synthesis. However, because they are active against ceain bacteria as well (which do not have ergosterol), other mechanisms of action also appear to be involved. Ketoconazole (KTZ): It is the first orally effective broad-spectrum antifungal drug, useful in both dermatophytosis and deep myc osis. The oral absorption of KTZ is facilitated by gastric acidity because it is more soluble at lower pH. Hepatic metabolism is extensive; metabolites are excreted in urine and faeces. Elimination of KTZ is dose dependent: tlh varies from llh to 6 hours. Penetration in CSF is poor: not effective in fungal men ingitis. However, therapeutic concentrations are attained in the skin and vaginal fluid. ESSENTIALS OF MEDICAL PHARMACOLOGY K.D.TRIPATHI SIXTH EDITION PAGE NO:761,762",general_faq

Most common cause of gangrene of foot of 30 years old farmer who is a chronic smoker -,,"All four can cause gangrene (Myocardial infarction can cause gangrene by thromboembolism)
Lets see, each option one by one.

Raynauds disease 

Is ds of young women* (F:M ratio is 5:1)
commonly the upper limbs* are affected specially the fingers (the thumb is generally escaped)
The disease is characterized by Raynauds phenomenon* which is a series of attacks of
Local syncope → digits become cold and white*
Local asphyxia → digits turn blue with burning sensation*
Local recovery →digits regain normal colour*


Pulses remain unaffected* as this is the disease which affects arterioles
With the help of points (a) and (b) Raynauds ds can be ruled out.

Atherosclerosis (Senile gangrene)

Seen in elderly people over 50 years of age.
Thus because of age factor we can rule out atherosclerosis.

Myocardial infaction

Age factor again helps in ruling it out as MI is generally seen in elderly, though its incidence is increasing in young, but it cannot be a more common cause than Buerger's disease.

Buerger's (Thromboangitis obliterans)  Usual victims of this ds are young men below 40 yrs of age, who are smokers (ds is not seen in females and nonsmokers).

Buerger ds is the inflammatory reaction in the arterial wall with involvement of the neighbouring vein and nerve, terminating in thrombosis of the artery.
It characterstically involves small and medium sized arteries (plantars, tibial and radial artery)
Both upper and lower extremities are affected.
In lower extremity the ds. occurs beyond the popliteal artery. In upper extremity the ds occurs beyond the brachial art.
Early in the course of Buergers ds the superficial veins are involved producing the characterstic migratory, recurrent superficial thrombophlebitis.
An imp difference with atheroselerosis is that, atherosclerosis is a disease of large sized arteries, buergers is a ds of small arteries.",general_faq

The minimal current amplitude of indefinite durationrequired for the depolarization threshold of the cell membranes is:,,"Rheobase is the minimal current amplitude of indefinite duration that results in the depolarization threshold of the cell membranes being reached (i.e. an action potential or the contraction of a muscle). Chronaxie (or chronaxy) is the minimum time over which an electric current, double the strength of the rheobase, needs to be applied, in order to stimulate a muscle fiber or nerve cell. In the case of a nerve or single muscle cell, rheobase is half the current that needs to be applied for the duration of chronaxie to result in an action potential or muscle twitch. Refractory period is a sho period after a nerve or muscle cell fires during which thecell cannot respond to additional stimulation. The minimal stimulus that produces excitation of any structure, eliciting a motor response is known as threshold.",general_faq

False rejection of a true null hypothesis is due to?,,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Type I error Statistical errors Statistical errors are used to describe possible errors made in statistical decision. Before reading about the types of error you must know null hypothesis because these tests are related to null hypothesis. Null hypothesis says - Any kind of difference or significance you see in a set of data is due to chance and not significant that means there is no variation (difference) exists between variables. Null hypothesis testing (e.g., in Chisquare test) is used to make a decision about whether : - i) The data contradict the null hypothesis - That means there is true difference (which is significant) between variables and it is not due to chance. Or ii) The data approve the null hypothesis There is no difference between variables and the difference you see is due to chance. Now see types of error :? There are two basic type of statistical errors : ? Type I error Type II error Type I error It is also known as an error of first kind or a-error or false positive. This type of error rejects null hypothesis when it is true - False rejection of null hypothesis. That means in real there is no difference (as null hypothesis says) but we observe a difference (by rejecting the null hypotesis due to error). In very simple words ""we observe a difference when it is not true"" - false positive. One of the simplest example of this would be if a test shows that a women is pregnant when in reality she is not, i.e., she is false positive for pregnancy. Probability of type-I error is given by 'P-value' (probability of declaring a significant difference when actually it is not present). Significance (a) level is the maximum tolerable probability of type I error. Significance (a) level is fixed in advance and calculation of P value (probability of type I error) can be less than, equal to or greater than the significance (a) level. If the probability of type I error (P -value) is less than significance (a) level, the results are declared statistically significant. Therefore, to declare the results statistical significant, type I error (a-level) should be kept to minimum . Type I error is more serious that type II error. Type II error It is also known as an error or second kind or A-error or false negative. This type of error accept/fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is false False acceptance of null hypothesis. That means we fail to observe a difference when in truth there is one - False negative. An example of this would be if a test shows that a woman is not pregnant when in reality she is i.e., she is false negative.",general_faq

Intermediate host for schistosoma haematobium is: March 2013,,"Ans. D i.e. Fresh water snail Schistosoma haematobium It is an impoant digenetic trematode, and is found in the Middle East, India, Pougal and Africa. It is a major agent of schistosomiasis; more specifically, it is associated with urinary schistosomiasis. Adults are found in the Venous plexuses around the urinary bladder and the released eggs traverse the wall of the bladder causing haematuria and fibrosis of the bladder. The bladder becomes calcified, and there is increased pressure on ureters and kidneys otherwise known as hydronephrosis. Inflammation of the genitals due to S. haematobium may contribute to the propagation of HIV. Studies have shown the relationship between S. haematobium infection and the development of squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder Life cycle The female fluke lays as many as 30 eggs per day which migrate to the lumen of the urinary bladder and ureters. The eggs are eliminated from the host into the water supply with micturition. In fresh water, the eggs hatch forming free swimming miracidia which penetrate into the intermediate snail host (Bulinus spp., e.g. B. globosus, B. forskalii, B. nyassanus and B. truncatus). Inside the snail, the miracidium sheds it epithelium and develops into a mother sporocyst. After two weeks the mother begins forming daughter sporocysts. Four weeks after the initial penetration of the miracardium into the snail furcocercous cercariae begin to be released. The cercariae cycle from the top of the water to the bottom for three days in the search of a human host. Within half an hour the cercariae enter the host epithelium",general_faq

Exon 2 can, therefore, have these extra 19 nucleotides at its 5'-end. The presence of these extra nucleotides in the coding region of the mutant mRNA molecule will prevent the ribosome from translating the message into a normal b-globin protein molecule. Those mRNA for which the normal splice site is used to remove the first intron will be normal, and their translation will produce normal b-globin protein.Ref: Lippincott illustrated review, Sixth edition",symptoms_diagnosis

Despite the previous use of the term ""necrotizing enterocolitis"" to describe NE cases, necrotizing enterocolitis is a different inflammatory illness seen in newborns and is beyond the scope of this review. NE is a clinical entity initially described in leukemic pediatric patients. It has also been repoed in adults with hematologic malignancies such as leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, aplastic anemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes, as well as other immunosuppressive causes such as AIDS, therapy for solid tumors, and organ transplant. The true incidence of NE is unknown. One systematic review published in 2005 suggested a pooled incidence of 5.6% in hospitalized adults with hematological malignancies, chemotherapy for solid tumors, and aplastic anemia. The repoed moality also varies with rates as high as 50%. NE was repoed initially after the use of taxane drugs, but more recently an increasing number of chemotherapeutic drugs have been implicated. Other drugs linked to NE include cytosine arabinoside, gemcitabine, vincristine, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, leuvocorin, and daunorubicin. Immunosuppressive therapy for organ transplant, antibiotics, and sulfasalazine for the treatment of rheumatoid ahritis have also been considered causes of NE. PATHOGENESIS The exact pathogenesis of NE is not completely understood. The main elements in disease onset appear to be intestinal mucosal injury together with neutropenia and the immunocompromised state of the afflicted patients. These initial conditions lead to intestinal edema, engorged vessels, and a disrupted mucosal surface, which becomes more vulnerable to bacterial intramural invasion. Chemotherapeutic agents can cause direct mucosal injury (mucositis) or can predispose to distension and necrosis, thereby altering intestinal motility. Cytosine arabinoside (cytarabine) is a chemotherapeutic agent used to treat leukemia and lymphoma that is paicularly associated with the development of NE. Intestinal leukemic infiltration is another potential factor in the pathogenesis of NE, which may explain the presence of acute myelogenous leukemia presenting as NE before the onset of chemotherapy regimens Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 836",symptoms_diagnosis

Which is the most common site of metastatic disease-,,"Invasion and metastasis are complex processes involving multiple discrete steps; they begin with local tissue invasion, followed byinfiltration of nearby blood and lymphatic vessels by cancer cells.Malignant cells are eventually transpoed through haematogenousand lymphatic spread to distant sites within the body, where theyform micrometastases that will eventually grow into macroscopicmetastatic lesions Cadherin-1 (CDH1) is a calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesionglycoprotein that facilitates assembly of organised cell sheets intissues, and increased expression is recognised as an antagonistof invasion and metastasis. In situ tumours usually retain CDH1production, whereas loss of CDH1 production due to down-regulation or occasional mutational inactivation of CDH1 hasbeen observed in human cancers, suppoing the theory thatCDH1 plays a key role in suppression of invasion and metastasis.Cross-talk between cancer cells and cells of the surroundingstromal tissue is involved in the acquired capability for invasivegrowth and metastasis. Mesenchymal stem cells in tumourstroma have been found to secrete CCL5, a protein chemokinethat helps recruit leucocytes into inflammatory sites. With thehelp of paicular T-cell-derived cytokines (interleukin (IL)-2and interferon-gamma (IFN-g)), CCL5 induces proliferation andactivation of natural killer cells and then acts reciprocally oncancer cells to stimulate invasive behaviour. Macrophages atthe tumour periphery can foster local invasion by supplyingmatrix-degrading enzymes such as metalloproteinases andcysteine cathepsin proteases.The lungs, liver, brain, and bones are the most common metastasis locations from solid tumors.

Insulin causes lipogenesis by all except:,,"Inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase Role of insulin in lipogenesis: Insulin promotes lipogenesis by increasing activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity, the principal enzyme of lipogenesis Insulin promotes the entry of glucose in some tissues such as skeletal muscle and adipocytes and thus increases the availability of pyruvate for fatty acid synthesis and glycerol 3-phosphate for esterification of the newly formed fatty acids. [Note that glucose transpo in some cells of body are insulin-independent - hepatocytes, RBCs, cells of nerveous system, corneal Insulin also activates pyruvate dehydrogenase (only in adipose tissue, not in liver) which catalyzes pyruvate into Acetyl-CoA the building blocks of fatty acids. Insulin decreases intracellular cAMP and thus inhibits lipolysis in adipose tissue.

An EDH is nearly always associated with a skull fracture and is more common in young male patients. The skull fracture is asso- ciated with tearing of a meningeal artery and a haematoma accumulates in the space between bone and dura. The most common site is temporal, as the pterion is not only the thinnest part of the skull but also overlies the largest meningeal artery - the middle meningeal.# An EDH may also occur in other regions such as frontal as well as in the posterior fossa. They are not always arte- rial: disruption of a major dural venous sinus can result in an EDH. The force required to sustain a skull fracture can be surprisingly small - a fall from standing or a single blow to the head.# The classical presentation of an EDH, occurring in less than one-third of cases, is initial injury followed by a lucid interval when the patient complains of a headache but is fully alert and orientated with no focal deficit.

All are true about ketone bodies except,,"KETOSIS Under ceain metabolic conditions associated with a high rate of fatty acid oxidation, liver produces considerable quantities of compounds like acetoacetate and bbb-OH butyric acid, which pass by diffusion into the blood. Acetoacetate continually undergoes spontaneous decarboxylation to produce acetone. These three substances are collectively known as ""ketone bodies"" (or ""acetone bodies""). Sometimes also called as ""ketones"", which is rather a misnomer. KETONE BODY FORMATION IN LIVER (KETOGENESIS) Enzymes are mitochondrial: Steps 1. Aceto-acetyl-CoA: Aceto-acetyl-CoA is the staing material for ketogenesis. This can arise in two ways: (a)Directly during the course of b-oxidation of fatty acids, or (b)As a result of condensation of two C-2 units, i.e. 'active acetate' (acetyl-CoA) by reversal of thiolase reaction. 2. Formation of Acetoacetate: Acetoacetate is the first ketone body to be formed. This can occur in two ways: a) By deacylation: Acetoacetate can be formed from aceto-acetyl-CoA by simple deacylation catalysed by the enzyme aceto-acetyl-CoA deacylase. SECTION FOUR when excessive amount of ketone bodies are formed, the The above does not seem to be the major pathway deacylation reaction is not enough to cope up. (b) Second pathway: Formation of acetoacetate intermediate production of ""bbb-OH-bbb-methyl glutaryl CoA"" (HMG-CoA). Present opinion ours the HMG-CoA pathway as the major route of ketone body formation. Steps Involves two steps: * Condensation of aceto-acetyl-CoA with another molecule of acetyl-CoA to form b-OH-b methyl glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) catalysed by the enzyme HMG-CoA synthase (mitochondrial enzyme). *HMG-CoA is then acted upon by an another enzyme, HMG-CoA Lyase, which is also mitochondrial enzyme, to produce one molecule ""acetoacetate"" and one molecule of acetyl-CoA (Fig. 25.10). Note *Both the enzymes HMG-CoA synthase and HMG-CoA Lyase are mitochondrial and must be available in mitocondrion for ketogenesis to occur. *Both the enzymes are present in liver cells mitochon- dria only. *A marked increase in activity of HMG-CoA Lyase has been noted in fasting. *HMG-CoA is a committed step. Cholesterol also can be formed by ""HMG-CoA reductase"". 3. Formation of Acetone: As stated earlier, acetone is formed from acetoacetate by spontaneous decarboxy- lation (Non-enzymatic). 4.Formation of b-OH Butyrate: Acetoacetate once formed is conveed to b-OH-butyric acid; the reaction is catalysed by the enzyme b-OH-butyrate dehydro- genase, which is present in liver and also found in many other tissues. b-OH-butyrate is quantitatively the predominant ketone body present in blood and urine in KetosisRef: Textbook of Medical Biochemistry Dr (Brig) MN Chatterjea Rana Shinde, page no: 425,426",general_faq

"A 62-year-old man is admitted to the hospital with dull, diffuse abdominal pain. A CT scan reveals a tumor at the head of the pancreas. The abdominal pain is mediated by afferent fibers that travel initially with which of the following nerves?",,"The afferent fibers mediating the pain from the head of the pancreas run initially with the greater thoracic splanchnic nerves. The greater splanchnic nerves arise from sympathetic ganglia at the levels of T5 to T9 and innervate structures of the foregut and thus the head of the pancreas. Running within these nerves are visceral afferent fibers that relay pain from foregut structures to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Also entering the dorsal horn are the somatic afferents from that vertebral level, which mediate pain from the body wall. Intercostal nerves T1 to T12 provide the terminal part of the pathway to the spinal cord of visceral afferents for pain from the thorax and much of the abdomen. Therefore, pain fibers from the pancreas pass by way of the splanchnic nerves to the sympathetic chains and then, by way of communicating rami, to ventral rami of intercostal nerves, finally entering the spinal cord by way of the dorsal roots. The phrenic nerve innervates the diaphragm and also carries visceral afferents from mediastinal pleura and the pericardium, but it does not carry with it any visceral afferent fibers from the pancreas. The vagus nerve innervates the pancreas with parasympathetic fibers and ascends all the way up to the medulla where it enters the brain. It has no visceral afferent fibers for pain. The subcostal nerve is from the level of T12 and innervates structures below the pancreas and carries no visceral afferents from the pancreas.",symptoms_diagnosis

Liposomal amphotericin B has the following advantage over conventional amphotericin B:,,"Amphotericin B (AMB): It is obtained from Streptomyces nodosus. Chemistry and mechanism of action The polyenes possess a macrocyclic ring, one side of which has several conjugated double bonds and is highly lipophilic, while the other side is hydrophilic with many OH groups. A polaraminosugar and a carboxylic acid group are present at one end in some. They are all insoluble in water and unstable in aqueous medium. The polyenes have high affinity for ergosterol present in fungal cell membrane: combine with it, get inseed into the membrane and several polyene molecules together orient themselves in such a way as to form a &;micropore&;. The hydrophilic side forms the interior of the pore through which ions, amino acids and other watersoluble substances move out. The micropore is stabilized by membrane sterols which fill up the spaces between the AMB molecules on the lipophilic side-constituting the outer surface of the pore. Thus, cell permeability is markedly increased. New amphotericin B formulations In an attempt to improve tolerability of i.v. infusion of AMB, reduce its toxicity and achieve targeted delivery, 3 new lipid formulations of AMB have been produced. (a) Amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC): Contains 35% AMB incorporated in ribbon like paicles of dimyristoyl phospholipids. ( b ) Amphotericin B colloidal dispersion (ABCO). Disc shaped paicles containing 50% each of AMB and cholesteryl sulfate are prepared as aqueous dispersion (c) Lpi osomal amphotericin B (small unilamellar vesicles SUV): Consists of 10% AMB incorporated in uniform sized (60-80 nM) unilamellar liposomes made up of lecithin and other biodegradable phospholipids. The special features of these preparations are: * They, except ABCD, produce milder acute reaction (especially liposomal formulation) on i.v. infusion. * They can be used in patients not tolerating infusion oi conventional AMB formulation. * They have lower nephrotoxicity. * They cause minimal anaemia. * The liposomal preparation delivers AMB paicularh* to reticuloendothelial cells in liver and spleen-----especialh valuable for kala azar and in immunocompromised patients. However, some preparations, especially ABLC and ABCD, produce lower AMB levels and their clinical efficacy relative to conventional formulations appear to be lower. Though none of the above formulations is more effectivein deep mycosis than conventional AMB, the liposomal AMB reduces equivalent blood levels, has similar clinical efficacy with less acute reaction and renal toxicity. It thus apears more satisfactory. ESSENTIALS OF MEDICAL PHARMACOLOGY K.D.TRIPATHI SIXTH EDITION PAGE NO:757,758,759",general_faq

Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy is initiated in which of the following phases of Acute Renal Failure:,,"Answer is B (Maintenance) Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy should be initiated during the Maintenance phase (Oliguric Phase) of Acute Renal Failure. Maintenance phase refers to the phase of Renal Failure in which the renal injury becomes established. It is also known as the Oliguric Phase. During this phase the GFR and Urine output progressively decrease until they stabilize at their lowest. Fluid retention gives rise to edema, water intoxication, and pulmonary congestion if the period of oliguria is prolonged. Hypeension frequently develops during this phase. Uremic complications and Electrolyte imbalance typically arise during this phase. Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CR) or Dialysis should be initiated in this phase. The oliguric-anuric phase generally lasts 10 to 14 days but can last for several more. The longer the patient remains in this phase, the poorer the prognosis for a return to normal renal function.",treatment_procedure

First investigation done for abnormal uterine bleeding in reproductive age group is _______,,"The first investigation for abnormal uterine bleeding is Urine Beta HCG to rule ouut pregnancy. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding(AUB): is a common and debilitating condition. Chronic AUB was defined as &;bleeding from the uterine corpus that is abnormal in volume, regularity and/or timing that has been present for the majority of the last 6 months. AUB may affect females of all ages. Factors that influence incidence most greatly are age and reproductive status. A structured approach for establishing the cause using the FIGO PALM COEIN classification system will facilitate accurate diagnosis and inform treatment options. In the reproductive age group , the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis matures, and anovulatory uterine bleeding is encountered less often. The diagnostic goal is exclusion of pregnancy and identification of the underlying pathology to allow optimal treatment. Miscarriage, ectopic pregnancies, and hydatidiform moles may cause life-threatening hemorrhage. Pregnancy complications are quickly excluded with determination of urine and serum Beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG levels). This is typically obtained on all reproductive-aged women.

This occurs at following sites.Complex I (NADH to CoQ) is inhibited by: - Barbiturates (amobarbital), Piericidin A (an antibiotic), rotenone (an insectiside), chlorpromazine (a tranquilizer), and guanethidine (an antihypertensive). These inhibitors block the transfer of reducing equivalents from FeS protein to CoQ.Complex II is inhibited by : - Carboxin and TTFA inhibit transfer of electon from FADH2 to CoQ, whereas malanate competitively inhibit from succinate to complex II.Complex III (Cytochrome b to cytochrome Cl) is inhibited by : - Dimercaprol, antimycin A, BAL (British anti lewisite), Naphthyloquinone. These inhibitors block the transfer of electrons from cytochrome b to cytochrome C i.Complex IV (cytochrome C oxidase) is inhibited by : - Carbon monoxide, CN-, ITS and azide (N3). These inhibitors block the transfer of electrons from cytochrome aa3 to molecular oxygen and therefore can totally arrest cellular respiration.Inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylationThese compounds directly inhibit phosphorylation of ADP to .ATP. Oligomycin inhibits Fo component of F0F1 ATPase. Atractiloside inhibits translocase, a transport protein that transports ADP into mitochondria for phosphorylation into ATP.UncouplesAs the name suggests, these componds block the coupeling of oxidation with phosphorylation.

In hyperkalemia with bradycardia treatment is: -,,"The treatment for hyperkalemia can be thought of in 3 distinct steps. First, antagonize the effects of hyperkalemia at the cellular level (membrane stabilization). Second, decrease serum potassium levels by promoting the influx of potassium into cells throughout the body.(insulin,beta2 agonist) Third, remove potassium from the body.(k+resins) In cells with calcium-dependent action potentials, such as SA and atrioventricular nodal cells, and in cells in which the sodium current is depressed, an increase in extracellular calcium concentration will increase the magnitude of the calcium inward current and the Vmax by increasing the electrochemical gradient across the myocyte. This would be expected to speed impulse propagation in such tissues, reversing the myocyte depression seen with severe hyperkalemia. The effects of intravenous calcium occur within 1 to 3 minutes but last for only 30 to 60 minutes. Therefore, fuher, more definitive treatment is needed to lower serum potassium levels. Calcium gluconate is the preferred preparation of intravenous calcium. The dose should be 10 mL of a 10% calcium gluconate solution infused over 2 to 3 minutes.",nutrition_advice

True about carotid body receptors ?,,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Dopamine is neurotransmitter Peripheral chemoreceptors The peripheral chemoreceptors which regulate respiration are located in the carotid body and aoic bodies. These bodies are located in the connective tissue associated with the vessel wall, at the bifurcation of the common carotid, and on the arch of aoa, respectively. The characteristic cells of both these structures are called glomus cells. Type I glomus cells have a high dopamine content, which they possibly employ as a neurotransmetter. Peripheral chemoreceptors convey information to the DRG of neurons in medulla, for which purpose the afferent neurons from the carotid bodies pass through glossopharyngeal nerve and from the aoic bodies pass through vagus nerve. The most potent natural stimulus for peripheral chemoreceptors is low aerial P02 (hypoxic hypoxia). The other stimuli which activate peripheral chemoreceptors are high aerial PCO2, and an increase in aerial hydrogen ion concentration (acidosis or low pH). The response to activation of peripheral chemoreceptors is an increase in pulmonary ventilation through an increase in the rate and depth of breathing. The blood flow to peripheral chemoreceptors, on per unit mass basis, is the highest to any tissue in the body. With a blood flow of 2000 ml/min/100 gm tissue, the carotid and aoic bodies, inspite of their high metabolic rate, hardly remove any oxygen from the blood supplies to them. That is why the aeriovenous oxygen difference is negligible in these bodies. Thus these structures are idealy built to sense change in aerial P02. It is good to keep in mind that stimulation of peripheral chemoreceptors not only stimulates medullary respiratory centers but also medullary vasomotor center. Therefore, the response to their stimulation is tachycardia, vasoconstriction and increase BP along with hyperventilation.",general_faq

A patient with an infected human bite of the hand requires hospitalization for appropriate drainage procedures, Gram stain and culture of the exudate, vigorous cleaning, debridement, and appropriate antibiotics. The infected wound should be left open and allowed to heal by secondary intention (healing by granulation tissue rather than closure with sutures). Empiric antibiotic therapy for an infected bite should be penicillinase-resistant; amoxicillin-clavulanate orally, or ticarcillin-clavulanate or ampicillin-sulbactam IV are good choices. Antibiotic prophylaxis for noninfected bite wounds remains controversial, but some experts recommend prophylaxis for all significant human bites.",general_faq

Which of the following is not an inflammatory mediator,,"steps: (1) migration and proliferation of fibroblasts into the site of injury and (2) deposition of ECM proteins produced by these cells. The recruitment and activation of fibroblasts to syn- thesize connective tissue proteins are driven by many growth factors, including PDGF, FGF-2 (described earlier), and TGF-b. The major source of these factors is inflamma- tory cells, paicularly macrophages, which are present at sites of injury and in granulation tissue. Sites of inflamma- tion are also rich in mast cells, and in the appropriate chemotactic milieu, lymphocytes may be present as well. Each of these cell types can secrete cytokines and growth factors that contribute to fibroblast proliferation and activation. As healing progresses, the number of proliferating fibroblasts and new vessels decreases; however, the fibro- blasts progressively assume a more synthetic phenotype, so there is increased deposition of ECM. Collagen synthe- sis, in paicular, is critical to the development of strength in a healing wound site. As described later, collagen syn- thesis by fibroblasts begins early in wound healing (days 3 to 5) and continues for several weeks, depending on the size of the wound. Net collagen accumulation, however, depends not only on increased synthesis but also on diminished collagen degradation (discussed later). Ulti- mately, the granulation tissue evolves into a scar composed of largely inactive, spindle-shaped fibroblasts, dense collagen, fragments of elastic tissue, and other ECM com- ponents (Fig. 2-30, B). As the scar matures, there is proA A gressive vascular regression, which eventually transforms the highly vascularized granulation tissue into a pale, largely avascular scar. Growth Factors Involved in ECM Deposition and Scar Formation Many growth factors are involved in these processes, including TGF-b, PDGF, and FGF. Because FGF also is involved in angiogenesis, it was described earlier. Here we briefly describe the major propeies of TGF-b and PDGF. * Transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) belongs to a family of homologous polypeptides (TGF-b1, -b2, and -b3) that includes other cytokines such as bone morphogenetic proteins. The TGF-b1 isoform is widely distributed and is usually referred to as TGF-b. The active factor binds to two cell surface receptors with serine-threonine kinase activity, triggering the phosphorylation of transcription factors called Smads. TGF-b has many and often oppo- site effects, depending on the cell type and the metabolic state of the tissue. In the context of inflammation and repair, TGF-b has two main functions: TGF-b stimulates the production of collagen, fibro- nectin, and proteoglycans, and it inhibits collagen degradation by both decreasing proteinase activity and increasing the activity of tissue inhibitors of pro- teinases known as TIMPs (discussed later on). TGF-b is involved not only in scar formation after ref Robbins 9/e p83",general_faq

Cognitive model of depression is given by ?,,"Beck Cognitive therapy is a psychotherapy developed by American pyschiatrist Aaron T. Beck. Cognitive therapy is one of the therapeutic approaches within the larger group of cognitive behavioural therapies. Cognitive therapy seeks to help the client overcome difficulties by identifying and changing dysfunctional thinking, behaviour and emotional responses. This involves helping clients develop skills for modifying beliefs, identifying distoed thinkings, relative to others in different ways and changing behaviours. Treatment is based on collaboration between client and therapist and on testing beliefs. Therapy may consist of testing the assumptions which one makes and identifying how some of one's usually unquestioned thoughts are distoed, unrealistic and unhelpful. Once, those thoughts have been challenged, ones feelings about the subject matter of those thoughts are more easily subject to change. Beck initially focussed on depression and developed a list of errors in thought that he proposed could maintain depression, including arbitrary inference, selective abstraction, over generalization and magnification (of negatives) and minimization (of positives). According to Beck's theorey of the etiology of depression, depressed people acquire a negative view of the world in childhood and adolescence. Children and adolescent who suffer from depression acquire this negative view earlier. Depressed people acquire such view through a loss of a parent, rejection by peers, (criticism from teachers or parents, the depressive attitude and other negative events). When the person with such view encounters a situation that resembles the original conditions of the learned view in some way, even remotely, the negative views of the persons are activated. A simple example may illustrate the principle of how cognitive therapy works Having made a mistake at work, a person may believe ""I am useless and can't do anything right at work"". Strongly believing this then tends to worsen his mood. The problem may be worsened fuher if the individual reacts by avoiding activities and then behaviourally confirming the negative belief to himself. As a result, any adaptive response and fuher constructive consequences become unlikely, which reinforces the original belief of being useless. In therapy, the latter example could be identified as a self fulfilling prophecy or ""problem cycle"" and the effos of the therapist and client would be directed at working together to change it.",general_faq
A 22 years old man presents with a solitary 2 cm space occupying lesion of mixed echogenecity in the right lobe of the liver on USG. The rest of the liver is normal. Which of the following test should be done next?,,MRI as the diagnostic test of choice for hepatic hemangioma at most centers. Nuclear medicine studies may be used to confirm the diagnosis when a probable hemangioma is detected on ultra-sonography. Nuclear medicine studies may also help to clarify the nature of a lesion when the diagnosis is equivocal on CT or MRI. Percutaneous biopsy of a hepatic hemangioma carries an increased risk of hemorrhage. Liver biopsy is contraindicated in most circumstances where a hemangioma is high in the differential diagnosis of a hepatic mass.

Which is NOT pyrogenic Interleukin,,"(C) IL-4 # Pyrogenic cytokines: Known pyrogenic cytokines include IL-1, IL-6, TNF, ciliary neurotropic factor (CNTF), and interferon (INF)a. Others probably exist; although IL-18 - a membrane of the IL-1 family - does not appear to be pyrogenic cytokine. Each cytokine is encoded by a separate gene, and each pyrogenic cytokine has been shown to cause fever in laboratory animals and in humans. When injected into humans, IL-1, IL-6 and TNF produce fever at low doses (10 to 100 ng/kg).> Fever, characterized by an elevation of body temperature, usually by 1deg to 4degC, is one of the most prominent manifestations of the acute-phase response, especially when inflammation is caused by infection. Fever is produced in response to substances called pyrogens that act by stimulating prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in the vascular and perivascular cells of the hypothalamus. Bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS; called exogenous pyrogens), stimulate leukocytes to release cytokines such as IL-1 & TNF (called endogenous pyrogens) that increase the levels of cyclooxygenases that convert AA into prostaglandins. In the hypothalamus the PGs, especially PGE2, stimulate the production of neurotransmitters, which function to reset the temperature set point at a higher level. IL-4 is involved in immediate hypersensitivity reactions.",general_faq

Prophylactic antibiotics can be used to prevent meningitis. Acetazolamide decreases CSF formation. These measures can be combined with lumbar drain if indicated. Surgical repair can be done by the following: 1. Neurosurgical intracranial approach. 2. Extradural approaches such as external ethmoidectomy for cribriform plate and ethmoid area, trans-septal sphenoidal approach for sphenoid and osteoplastic flap approach for frontal sinus leak. 3. Transnasal endoscopic approach. With the advent of endoscopic surgery for nose and sinuses, most of the leaks from the anterior cranial fossa and sphenoid sinus can be managed endoscopically with a success rate of 90% with first attempt. Principles of repair include: (a) Defining the sites of bony areas . It can be (i) Cribriform plate (ii) Lateral lamina close to anterior ethmoid aery (iii) Roof of ethmoid (iv) Frontal sinus leak (v) Sphenoid sinus (b) Preparation of graft site. (c) Underlay grafting of the fascia extradurally followed by placement of mucosa (as a free graft or pedicled flap) (d) If bony defect is larger than 2 cm, it is repaired with cailage (from nasal septum or auricular concha) followed by placement of mucosa. (e) Placement of surgicel and gelfoam fuher strengthens the area. This is followed by a high antibiotic smeared nasal pack. Sometimes fat from the thigh or abdomen is used to plug the defect in place of fascia graft. (f) Lumbar drain if CSF pressure is high.

Given case repos on liver injuries after ceain antiviral agent treatments, this study examined the effects of lamivudine on alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin (TB) using a medical system database Ref Harrison20th edition pg 2675 Lamivudine has been used for treatment of chronic hepatitis B at a lower dose than for treatment of HIV/AIDS. It improves the seroconversion of e-antigen positive hepatitis B and also improves histology staging of the liver. Long-term use of lamivudine leads to emergence of a resistant hepatitis B virus (YMDD) mutant. Despite this, lamivudine is still used widely as it is well tolerated Lamivudine, commonly called 3TC, is an antiretroviral medication used to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS. It is also used to treat chronic hepatitis B when other options are not possible.It is effective against both HIV-1 and HIV-2.It is typically used in combination with other antiretrovirals such as zidovudine and abacavir. Lamivudine may be included as pa of post-exposure prevention in those who have been potentially exposed to HIV. Lamivudine is taken by mouth as a liquid or tablet HIV, high level resistance is associated with the M184V/I mutation in the reverse transcriptase gene as repoed by Raymond Schinazi's group at Emory University. GlaxoSmithKline claimed that the M184V mutation reduces ""viral fitness"", because of the finding that continued lamivudine treatment causes the HIV viral load to rebound but at a much lower level, and that withdrawal of lamivudine results in a higher viral load rebound with rapid loss of the M184V mutation; GSK therefore argued that there may be benefit in continuing lamivudine treatment even in the presence of high level resistance, because the resistant virus is ""less fit"". The COLATE study has suggested that there is no benefit to continuing lamivudine treatment in patients with lamivudine resistance. A better explanation of the data is that lamivudine continues to have a paial anti-viral effect even in the presence of the M184V mutation. In hepatitis B, lamivudine resistance was first described in the YMDD (tyrosine-methionine-aspaate-aspaate) locus of the HBV reverse transcriptase gene. The HBV reverse transcriptase gene is 344 amino acids long and occupies codons 349 to 692 on the viral genome. The most commonly encountered resistance mutations are M204V/I/S. The change in amino acid sequence from YMDD to YIDD results in a 3.2 fold reduction in the error rate of the reverse transcriptase, which correlates with a significant growth disadvantage of the virus. Other resistance mutations are L80V/I, V173L and L180M Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 768",general_faq

True about keratoconus are all of the following except: September 2005,,"Ans. B: It manifests just after bih Keratoconus is frequently due to a congenital weakness of the cornea, though it manifests itself after pubey. However it can occur secondarily following trauma or Down's syndrome. Keratoconus is divided into mild, moderate, and advanced. Mild keratoconus - External and corneal signs are often absent or minimal. - A history of multiple inadequate spectacle corrections of one or both eyes may be noted and may include oblique astigmatism on refraction as well as moderate-to-high myopia. - Irregularly astigmatic keratometry values (egg-shaped), not necessarily on the steep side of normal (approximately 45 diopters (D)), are consistent with diagnosis. Diagnosis can be confirmed with computer-assisted videokeratography, which may reveal corneal inferior steepening (approximately 80% of keratoconus cases), central corneal astigmatic steepening (approximately 15% of keratoconus cases), or even bilateral temporal steepening (extremely rare). Diagnosis may also be aided by applying a diagnostic rigid contact lens with its base curve equal to the flat keratometry value. One observes a typical nipple pattern by use of sodium fluorescein dye in the underlying tear film. Moderate keratoconus One or more corneal signs of keratoconus are often present. Enhanced appearance of the corneal nerves is noted. Approximately 40% of eyes in patients with moderate keratoconus develop Vogt striae (fine-stress lines) in the deep stroma. Approximately 50% develop the deposition of iron in the basal epithelial cells in a (often paial) ring shape at the base of the conical protrusion called the Fleischer ring. Approximately 20% develop corneal scarring. Superficial corneal scarring can be fibular, nebular, or nodular. Deep stromal scarring may occur, perhaps representing resolved mini-hydrops events. Some patients show scarring at the level of the Descemet membrane (posterior limiting lamina), consistent in appearance with posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy. Paraxial (usually inferior to the pupil) stromal thinning may be appreciated. Keratometry values typically increase to 45-52 D. Distoion of the retinoscopy and direct ophthalmoscope red pupillary reflex may allow observation of ""scissoring"" or an inferior distoion termed the oil drop sign. The Munson sign is noted when, upon downgaze, a ""V"" shape is noted in the cornea's profile against the lower lid margin, an accentuation of the conical shape of the modest to advanced keratoconus cornea. Advanced keratoconus This often results in keratometry values greater than 52 D and enhancement of all corneal signs, symptoms, and visual loss/distoion. Vogt striae are seen in approximately 60% of eyes, and Fleischer ring and/or scarring are seen in approximately 70% of eyes. Acute corneal hydrops can occur. Treatment: In the early stages, vision may be improved with spectacles but contact lens are more beneficial as they eliminate the irregular corneal curvature. If the disease progresses and the cone hydrated, the most satisfactory treatment is corneal transplantation.",general_faq

How does the distal nephron differ functionally from the proximal tubule?,,"Proximal and distal convoluted tubule The site of action of acetazolamide is the proximal convoluted tubule and the site of action of the thiazides is the distal convoluted tubule. The distal nephron has a negative luminal potential because it is poorly permeable to negatively charged ions. Therefore, when Na+ is reabsorbed, negatively charged ions, primarily Cl-, lag behind, producing a negative intraluminal potential. Although a similar situation occurs in the proximal tubule, the proximal tubule has a higher permeability to Cl- and, therefore, does not develop as large a negative intraluminal potential. The distal nephron is less permeable to hydrogen than the proximal tubule. Aldosterone increases Na+ reabsorption from the distal nephron but has no effect on the proximal tubule. K+ is reabsorbed from the proximal tubule and secreted by the distal nephron.

A patient with hypeension is also having aoic dissection. Anti-hypeensive agent of choice is: September 2008,,"Ans. A: Sodium Nitroprusside Antihypeensive therapy in acute aoic dissection aims specifically to lessen pulsatile load or aoic stress, in order to retard the propagation of the dissection and prevent aoic rupture. The goals of treatment are to prevent myocardial ischemia, decrease left ventricular afterload, decrease myocardial oxygen consumption, and prevent rupture and bleeding from suture lines Nitroprusside is a potent direct aerial and venous dilator, acting through release of nitric oxide. It has a rapid onset of action, and a shoer half-life and thus is given in the form of continuous infusion. The hypotensive effects of nitroprusside can be unpredictable because it simultaneously causes potent venodilatation and peripheral aerial vasodilatation. This is especially the case for patients with severe left ventricular hyperophy and preload-dependent diastolic dysfunction. It has been shown to cause coronary steal; it can cause a significant reflex tachycardia, and it can decrease oxygen circulation. It is photosensitive, so it requires special handling. Its most serious adverse effect is in the form of cyanide toxicity, which occurs due to accumulation of its metabolites thiocyanate/ cyanide and its clinical presentation may vary leading to difficulty in diagnosis. Thus, it is recommended that this drug be used only when other intravenous antihypeensive agents are not available",general_faq

For example, if the study involves a procedure such as wound irrigation and the patients are randomized to have wounds irrigated with sterile saline on even days and tap water on odd days, a patient may present on an even day and the treating clinical investigator may elect not to enroll the patient in the study or to break the randomization, because they ""just think that this paicular wound needs saline irrigation.""

Increased blood flow through pulmonary valve --> Pulmonary ejection systolic murmur and delay & accentuated P2. o Early closure of A2 and delayed closure of P2 cause --> Widely split S2 (But this is usually masked by pansystolic murmur). o Larger volume reaches the left atrium -3 Left atrial hyperophy o Increased blood flow through mitral valve -3 Accentuated Si (But it is masked by pansystolic murmur) and delayed diastolic murmur. Note : o Ejection systolic murmur of pulmonary valve can not be separated from pansystolic murmur. o The effect of ejection systolic murmur is a selective transmission of pansystolic murmur to the upper left sternal border (pulmonary valve area) In this area ejection characteristic of this murmur can be recognized since it does not mask the aoic component of S2.

Drug of choice for absence seizures: March 2011,,"Ans. C: Valproate Sodium valproate is effective in absence/petit-mal seizures, combined grand mal and petit mal, myoclonic epilepsy, paial epilepsy, maniac depressive psychosis and as a prophylactic in febrile convulsion Absence seizures/Petit mal seizures (from the French for ""little illness"", a term dating from the late 18th century). Absences seizures are brief (usually less than 20 seconds), generalized epileptic seizures of sudden onset and termination. They have 2 essential components: - Clinically the impairment of consciousness (absence) - EEG generalized spike-and-slow wave discharges Absence seizures are broadly divided in typical and atypical absence seizures. Typical absence seizures usually occur in the context of idiopathic generalised epilepsies and EEG shows fast >2.5 Hz generalised spike-wave discharges. Atypical absence seizures: - Occur only in the context of mainly severe symptomatic or cryptogenic epilepsies of children with learning difficulties who also suffer from frequent seizures of other types such as atonic, tonic and myoclonic - Onset and termination is not so abrupt and changes in tone are more pronounced - Ictal EEG is of slow less than 2.5 Hz spike and slow wave. - The discharge is heterogeneous, often asymmetrical and may include irregular spike and slow wave complexes, fast and other paroxysmal activity. - Background interictal EEG is usually abnormal. Treatment of patients with absence seizures only is mainly with sodium valproate or ethosuximide, which are of equal efficacy controlling absences in around 75% of patients. Sodium valproate as a single drug is the DOC if tonic clonic seizures are also present or emerge during the therapy with ethosuximide Lamotrigine monotherapy is less effective with nearly half of the patients becoming seizure free.",medicine_info

"All the following features our ventricular tachycardia as the cause of broad-complex tachycardia, except -",,"Ventricular tachycardia can be classified based on its morphology: Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia means that the appearance of all the beats match each other in each lead of a surface electrocardiogram (ECG). Scar-related monomorphic ventricular tachycardia is the most common type and a frequent cause of death in patients having survived a hea attack, especially if they have weak hea muscle. RVOT tachycardia is a type of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia originating in the right ventricular outflow tract. RVOT morphology refers to the characteristic pattern of this type of tachycardia on an ECG. The source of the re-entry circuit can be identified by evaluating the morphology of the QRS complex in the V1 lead of a surface ECG. If the R wave is dominant (consistent with a right bundle branch block morphology), this indicates the origin of the VT is the left ventricle. Conversely, if the S wave is dominant (consistent with a left bundle branch block morphology, this is consistent with VT originating from the right ventricle or interventricular septum. Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, on the other hand, has beat-to-beat variations in morphology. This may appear as a cyclical progressive change in cardiac axis, previously referred to by its French name torsades de pointes (""twisting of the spikes""). However, at the current time, the term torsades de pointes is reserved for polymorphic VT occurring in the context of a prolonged resting QT interval. Another way to classify ventricular tachycardias is the duration of the episodes: Three or more beats in a row on an ECG that originate from the ventricle at a rate of more than 120 beats per minute constitute a ventricular tachycardia Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1423",nutrition_advice

Radiation induced thyroid cancer is -,,"Radiation-induced thyroid cancer Authors: Section Editors: Deputy Editor: INTRODUCTION Radiation exposure of the thyroid during childhood is the most clearly defined environmental factor associated with benign and malignant thyroid tumors. The risk of thyroid cancer following irradiation is related to radiation dose and age (greater for children exposed early in life), and the risk persists throughout life. Radiation exposure during childhood also increases the risk of benign thyroid nodules and hypothyroidism. The purpose of this topic is to review the evaluation of a patient with a history of childhood radiation exposure and how such a history affects treatment of patients with thyroid tumors. Radiation injury to other organs is reviewed separately. (See and .) RADIATION EXPOSURE Type of exposure -- Radiation exposure may be external or internal. *External - The predominant types of external radiation are diagnostic radiographs, therapeutic radiation for the treatment of cancer, and historical use of external radiation to treat a wide variety of nonmalignant conditions. External radiation also includes brachytherapy, whereby a sealed radiation source is placed adjacent to a treatment area. *Internal - Internal radiation exposure includes ingestion of foods or liquids contaminated with radioactivity or by inhalation of radioactive gases or paicles. Internal radiation occurs after exposure to nuclear fallout (from testing and accidents at operating nuclear power plants or above ground nuclear explosive testing) or after ingestion of radioiodine for diagnostic tests and for therapy of hypehyroidism.",general_faq

"An 8-hour-old term infant develops increased respiratory distress, hypothermia, and hypotension. A complete blood count (CBC) demonstrates a white blood cell (WBC) count of 2500/mL with 80% bands.

Rudolph et al, pp 1097-1099.) The radiograph shows diffuse that infiltrates bilaterally; this can be seen with neonatal pneumonia or primary surfactant deficiency. The rapid onset of the symptoms, the low WBC count with left shift, and the depicted chest x-ray findings, however, are typical of a patient with group B streptococcus (GBS) pneumonia. Appropriate management would include rapid recognition of symptoms, cardiorespiratory support, and prompt institution of antibiotics. Despite these measures, mortality from this infection is not uncommon. The other infectious causes listed do not present so early, and the noninfectious causes listed do not cause elevations in the band count. GBS disease in the infant is decreasing in incidence with better prevention strategies in the perinatal period; early screening in pregnancy and treatment with antibiotics just prior to delivery to eliminate GBS colonization markedly decreases the risk to the infant. Congenital syphilis can cause pneumonia, but it is diagnosed at birth along with other features including hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, rashes, hemolytic anemia, and others. Diaphragmatic hernia presents with early respiratory distress, but the diagnosis is confirmed clinically with bowel sounds heard in the chest and a radiograph that has loops of bowel located above the normal placement of the diaphragm. Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) causes an increase in respiratory rate and occasionally a low oxygen requirement; the history is often positive for a cesarean delivery, and the radiograph shows retained fluid in the fissures. TTN does not cause temperature instability nor an abnormal CBC. Chlamydial pneumonia is not a condition that occurs in an 8-hour-old infant; it is generally a mild pneumonia that can develop in an exposed infant at several weeks of life.",general_faq

There may also be a mediastinal shift away from the side of the hernia.o Historically, the surgical repair of a CDH was considered to be a surgical emergency' because it was believed that the abdominal viscera within the chest prevented the ability to ventilate. More recently with the recognition of the role of pulmnary hypertension and pulmonary hypoplasia and the adverse effects of early operative repair on the pulmonary function has caused a policy of delayed repair.o Thus most pediatric surgeons wait for a variable period (24 to 72 hrs) to allow for stabilization of the infant before doing surgical repair.Congenital diaphragmatic herniao It is the herniation of abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity through the diaphragmatic defecto The defect may be:Posterolateral (Bochdalek hernia)Retrosternal (Morgagni hernia)At the esophageal hiatus (hiatal hernia)Adjacent to the hiatus (paresophageal hernia)o Although all these defects are congenital, the term congenital diaphragmatic hernia is generally used for Bochdalek hernia.",general_faq

The following are attributes of hepatitis B infection except -,,"Hepatitis B may cause an acute viral hepatitis; however, acute infection is often asymptomatic, paicularly when acquired at bih. Many individuals with chronic hepatitis B are also asymptomatic. The risk of progression to chronic liver disease depends on the source and timing of infection . Veical transmission from mother to child in the perinatal period is the most common cause of infection worldwide and carries the highest risk of ongoing chronic infection. In this setting, adaptive immune responses to HBV may be absent initially, with apparent immunological tolerance. Several mechanisms contribute towards this: Firstly, the introduction of antigen in the neonatal period is tolerogenic. Secondly, the presentation of such antigen within the liver, as described above, promotes tolerance; this is paicularly evident in the absence of a significant innate or inflammatory response. Finally, very high loads of antigen may lead to so-called 'exhaustion' of cellular immune responses. The state of tolerance is not permanent, however, and may be reversed as a result of therapy, or through spontaneous changes in innate responses, such as interferon alpha (IFN-a) and NK cells, accompanied by host-mediated immunopathology. Chronic hepatitis can lead to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma, usually after decades of infection . Chronic HBV infection is a dynamic process that can be divided into five phases ; these are not necessarily sequential, however, and not all patients will go through all phases. It is impoant to remember that the virus is not directly cytotoxic to cells; rather, it is an immune response to viral antigens displayed on infected hepatocytes that initiates liver injury. This explains why there may be very high levels of viral replication but little hepatocellular damage during the 'immune-tolerant' phase. Hepatitis B core antigen Hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) is not found in the blood, but antibody to it (anti-HBc) appears early in the illness and rapidly reaches a high titre, which subsides gradually but then persists. Anti-HBc is initially of IgM type, with IgG antibody appearing later.

Chediak-Higashi syndrome is characterized by,,"Ans. a (Defects in phagolysosome function) (Ref. H - 17th/pg. Table 61-4)CHRONIC GRANULOMATOUS DISEASEChronic Granulomatous Disease presents before the age of 2 and can be transmitted through X-linked or autosomal pattern of inheritance. The defect lies in the inability to generate oxidative burst to kill organisms after being phagocytosed. The neutrophils lack enzyme NADPH oxidase, which plays an important role in production of microbicidal oxygen radicles. In the lab, the diagnosis can be confirmed through Nitro blue Tetrazolium reduction dye test, which will be negative. B cell and T cell functions are normal. Recurrent infections with catalase producing organisms are common. The NBT test is a measure of the respiratory burst in neutrophils and is used to screen for CGD. Neutrophils will reduce the dye NBT, a clear yellow water-soluble compound, to formazan upon stimulation of the respiratory burst. Formazan thus forms precipitates as a dark blue granular substance, which remains trapped in the cytoplasm. Patients with CGD lack a component of the oxidase system, which produces super oxide anion and thus cannot reduce NBT to formazan. Results are interpreted as follows: Normal (positive test) - cells with an orange-red nucleus and blue cytoplasm; Abnormal (negative test) - cells with an orange-red nucleus and colorless cytoplasm.Phagocytic cell deficiency:Leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome (type 1): Defect in LFA-1 integrin proteins on phagocytes. Presents early with recurrent bacterial infections, absent pus formation, and delayed separation of umbilicus.Chediak-Higashi disease:Autosomal recessive. Defect in microtubular function and lysosomal emptying of phagocytic cells. Presents with recurrent pyogenic infections by staphylococci and streptococci, partial albinism, and peripheral neuropathy.Chronic granulomatous disease:Defect in phagocytosis of neutrophils owing to lack of NADPH oxidase activity or similar enzymes.

Most sensitive diagnosis test for ectopic pregnancy,,"Transvaginal ultrasound Diagnosis of Ectopic pregnancy Pregnancy is definitely diagnosed by demonstrating intrauterine sac. - A normal intrauterine sac appears regular and well defined on ultrasound. So ectopic pregnancy can be diagnosed by demonstrating the absence of the intrauterine sac. In a woman in whom ectopic pregnancy is suspected because of pain, bleeding and positive pregnancy test, performance of vaginal sonography is the logical first step. If the sonography demonstrates live intrauterine fetus then ectopic pregnancy is extremely unlikely. Alternatively if the uterus is empty, an ectopic pregnancy can be diagnosed based on the visualization of an adnexal mass separate from the ovaries. 3-hCG hormones also play an impoant role in the diagnosis of pregnancy. fi HCG is a hormone secreted during pregnancy. It is positive in viually 100% of ectopic pregnancies. However, a positive test only confirms pregnancy and does not indicate whether it is intrauterine or extrauterine. In normal pregnancy pHCG should double up every 2 days but in ectopic pregnancy the rate of increase of fl hCG is slow. 13 hCG litres and ultrasound complement one another in detecting ectopic pregnancy and have led to earlier detection. By correlating fl hCG titres with ultrasound .findings an ectopic pregnancy can often be differentiated.from intrauterine pregnancy. An intrauterine sac should be visible by transvaginal ultrasound when the p hCG is approximately 1000 ml p/m1 and by transabdominal ultrasound approximately 1 week later when the fi hCG is 1800-3600 ?nip/int. Thus when an empty uterine cavity is seen with a 13 hCG litre above this threshold, the patient is likely to have an ectopic pregnancy. An empty cavity is less of a concern when a fihCG below this threshold is obtained. Serum progesterone measuremen A single measurement of serum progesterone may sometimes clarify the diagnosis when ectopic pregnancy is suspected, but Its accuracy is crude and the customary thresholds are < 5 ng/m and > 25 'tend. i.e.a value exceeding 25 ng/m1 excludes ectopic pregnancy with 97.5% sensitivity, value below 5 ng/ml occur in only .3 percent of normal regnancies. So normal pregnancies can be excluded if the progesterone level is below 5%. Surgical diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy :- Laparoscopy Direct visualization of the ,fallopian tubes and pelvis by diagnostic laparoscopy offers a reliable diagnosis in most cases of suspected ectopic pregnancy and a ready transition to definitive operative therapy. At times, identification of an early unruptured tubal pregnancy may be difficult even if the tube is .fully visualized. Inspite of the low morbidity and quick recovery time, laparoscopy usually is performed when, on the basis of noninvasive test or curettage results, the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is fairly ceain and medical therapy is not planned. In these cases laporoscopy is used both for therapeutic and diagnostic purpose. Laparotomy Open abdominal surgery is preferred when the woman is hemodynamically unstable or when laparoscopy is not feasible. Laparotomy should not be delayed while laparoscopy is performed in a woman with obvious abdominal hemorrhage that required immediate definitive treatment. Culdocentesis Culdocentesis is the transvaginal passage of a needle into the posterior cul-de-sac in order to determine whether free blood is present in the abdomen. This procedure is useful in the diagnosis of intraperitoneal bleeding. This procedure will reveal nonclotting blood if intra-abdominal bleeding has occurred. If culdocentesis is positive, laparoscopy or laparotomy should be performed immediately. Indeed, some argue that the main purpose of culdocentesis is, not in diagnosis but to better prioritize patients so that those with positive culdocentensis are taken immediately to the operating room. More on imaging procedures used in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy Vaginal sonography There has been much improvement in the early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy using vaginal sonography.

The underlying cause of these varied manifestations are defects in the dynein arms, spokes of microtubule doublets of cilia in the airways and the reproductive tract. Since sperm motility is dependent on the functioning of cilia, infeility frequently accompanies this disorder. Situs inversus occurs because ciliary function is necessary for cell migration during embryonic development. Azoospermia is not a feature of Kaagener's syndrome, as sperm production or survival is not affected in this disorder.

A codon codes for a single amino acid. This characteristic is called ?,,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Unambiguous Characteristics of genetic codes Genetic codes have following characteristics ? 1) Universal :- Each codon specifically codes for same amino acid in all species, e.g. UCA codes for serine and CCA codes for proline in all organisms. That means specificity of codon has been conserved from very early stages of evolution. Exception to the universality of genetic coder are found in human mitochondria, where the code :- a UGA codes for tryptophan instead of serving as a stop codon. AUA codes for methionine instead of isoleucine. CUA codes for threonine instead of leucine. LI AGA and AGG serve as stop codon instead of coding for arginine. 2) Unambiguous/Specific :- A paicular codon always codes for the same amino acid. For example CCU always codes for proline and UGG always codes for tryptophan. 3) Degeneracy/Redundancy :- A given amino acid may have more than one codon. For example, CCU, CCC, CCA and CCG all four codons code for proline. Therefore, there are 61 codons for 20 amino acids. 4) Stop or termination or nonsense codons:- Three of the 64 possible nucleotide triplets UAA (amber), UAG (Ochre) and UGA (opal) do not code for any amino acid. They are called nonsense codons that normally signal termination of polypeptide chains. Thus, though there are 64 possible triplet codons, only 61 codes for 20 amino acids (as remaining three are non-sense codons). 5) Non overlapping and nonpuntate (Comma less) :- During translation, the code is read sequentially, without spacer bases, from a fixed staing point, as a continuous sequence of bases, taken 3 at a time, e.g. AUGCUA GACUUU is read as AUG/CUA/GAC/UUU without ""ponctation"" (coma) between codons.",general_faq

In these circumstances, the hormone may activate a membrane receptor that does not open any ion channel but instead cause an internal change in the muscle fiber, such as release of Ca2+ from intracellular sarcoplasmic reticulum, the Ca2+ then induce contraction (Guyton 11th/98)IP3-DAG role (to favour as an ansiver)The acetycholine cause smooth muscle contraction by phospholipase C& IP.,, which increase the intracellular Ca2+ concentration-Gcrnong 22nd/83Role of CAMP & CGMP (Guyton 11th/98)CAMP & CGMP so called second messengers has many effects on smooth muscle, one of which is to change the degree of phosphorylation of several enzyme that indirectly inhibit contraction.""An increase in CAMP dampens the contraction response of smooth muscle to a given elevation of sarcoplasmic Ca2+-Harper 2 7th/579",general_faq

This hypocalcemia results in secondary hyperparathyroidism, a homeostatic response that initially maintains serum calcium levels at the expense of the skeleton. Due to the PTH-induced increase in bone turnover, alkaline phosphatase levels are often increased. In addition to increasing bone resorption, PTH decreases urinary calcium excretion while promoting phosphaturia. This results in hypophosphatemia, which exacerbates the mineralization defect in the skeleton. Reference : page 2466 Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 19th edition",nutrition_advice

Which of the following terms best describes this lesion?,,"The central neurons system and its overlying bones are subject to a variety of malformations and developmental diseases. The defect described in the question stem is a cranial encephalocele, in which brain herniates through a defect in the skull bones. The most common site for such a herniation is the occipital bone. Small defects in the occipital bone can be treated surgically, but large defects are very problematic, paicularly if significant herniation has occurred, since the brain becomes very vulnerable to trauma and infection. Meningocele is the term used when the meninges, but not the brain or spinal cord, herniate through a defect in the bony cranium or spinal column. Myelocele is the term used when the spinal cord herniates through a defect in the spinal column. Spina bifida refers to veebral defects through which the spinal cord or meninges may herniate.

What is the most likely condition predisposing the patient to the development of a breast abscess?,,"Acute mastitis, frequently complicated by breast abscess formation, typically develops in the postpaum period, when the nipples are first subjected to the physical stresses of breast feeding. Bacteria enter the breast cracks in the nipple, and flourish in the microenvironment of the lactating breast. Acute mastitis causes redness, pain, and swelling in the affected breast; Staph. aureus is the most common pathogen. Although endocarditis could send septic emboli to the breast, Staph. aureus endocarditis is more commonly associated with bacteremia and fevers, proliferative glomerulonephritis, valvular dysfunction, and emboli to the brain, kidneys, hea, and gut. Inflammatory breast carcinoma does not invoke an inflammatory response, and it is not associated with an infection. Inflammatory breast carcinoma is characterized by tumor spread into the dermal lymphatics, producing diffuse induration and skin tenderness with the typical peau d'orange appearance. Mastitis arising in the perimenopausal period is usually a chronic mastitis, caused by obstruction of ducts due to inspissated secretions. Chronic mastitis is sterile.

Vitamin K is required for,,"Carboxylation The only known biological role of vitamin K is as a cofactor for an enzyme carboxylase that catalyzes carboxylation of glutamic acid residues on vitamin K-dependent proteins. The key vitamin K-dependent proteins include: Coagulation proteins: factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX and X Anticoagulation proteins: proteins C, S and Z Bone proteins: osteocalcin and matrix-Gla protein Gas6 is a vitamin K-dependent protein that is found throughout the nervous system, as well in the hea, lungs, stomach, kidneys, and cailage. These proteins have in common the requirement to be post-translationally modified by carboxylation of glutamic acid residues (forming gamma-carboxyglutamic acid) in order to become biologically active. Prothrombin, for example, has 10 glutamic acids in the amino-terminal region of the protein which are carboxylated. Without vitamin K. the carboxylation does not occur and the proteins that are synthesized are biologically inactive. Carboxylation of glutamic acid residues is critical for the calcium-binding function of those proteins. Also Know There are two naturally occurring forms of vitamin K: - phylloquinone synthesized by plants - menaquinones synthesized by intestinal bacteria Synthetic forms of vitamin K are: - menadiotze - menadiol - menadiol acetate",nutrition_advice

A male patient 56 year old complains of swelling in legs. He is a known case of hypertension and is under treatment. On general physical examination pitting oedema is seen on legs and TSH level 3mU/L. Which of the following is not a cause of this condition?,,"Most leg swelling is caused by oedema, the accumulation of ﬂuid within the interstitial space. Unilateral swelling usually indicates a localised pathology in either the venous or the lymphatic system, while bilateral oedema often represents generalised ﬂuid overload combined with the effects of gravity. However, all causes of unilateral leg swelling may present bilaterally, and generalised ﬂuid overload may present with asymmetrical (and therefore apparently unilateral) oedema. Fluid overload may be the result of cardiac failure, pulmonary hypertension (even in the absence of right ventricular failure), renal failure, hypoalbuminaemia or drugs (calcium channel blockers, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and others).
 Approximately 60% of lean body weight is water, two-thirds of which is intracellular. Most of the remaining water is found in extracellular compartments in the form of interstitial fluid; only 5% of the body’s water is in blood plasma. As noted earlier, edema is an accumulation of interstitial fluid within tissues. 

Increase in hydrostatic pressure are mainly caused by disorders that impair venous return. Local increases in intravascular pressure caused, for example, by deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremity can cause edema restricted to the distal portion of the affected leg.
Reduction of plasma albumin concentrations leads to decreased colloidal osmotic pressure of the blood and loss of fluid from the circulation.
Edema may result from lymphatic obstruction that compromises resorption of fluid from interstitial spaces.

Circulation must be assessed looking for pulselessness, pallor, pain, paresthesia, and paralysis (the five p's), and capillary refill.# Compartment syndrome# Nerve damage- The median, radial, and ulnar nerves may be injured, with potential long-term pain and functional deficit. Fortunately, the injury is usually a neuropraxia, which recovers with conservative treatment.# Myositis ossificansLate Complications# Volkmann's ischemic contracture# Malunion- Cubitus varus (gun stock deformity) is the most common long-term complication resulting from a malunion of a supracondylar fracture of the humerus in children.- The deformity occurs as a result of residual coronal angulation. Corrective supracondylar osteotomy is performed mainly to improve the cosmetic appearance and not for functional reasons. The most popular method was lateral closing wedge osteotomy but it needs detailed preoperative planning, careful surgical technique but can still cause recurrent varus and lateral condylar prominence in older children.- In Dome osteotomy vulnerability of the radial nerve is the problem. Osteotomy with T-plate fixation gives very good correction of varus deformity, with stable fixation and good functional result but care must be taken to avoid injury to the radial nerve.# Supracondylar fracture of humerus undergoes medial tilt and can lead to varus deformity.- It can cause tardy ulnar nerve palsy.Rx of Supracondylar Fracture:",general_faq

Fernando Arias 3/e, p 220
Steroid therapy in preterm labour:

Steroids are recommended for all women in preterm labour before 32 weeks with or without membrane ruptures in whom there is no evidence of chorioamnionitis. According to ACOG, single dose steroid injection is recommended between 24 to 32 weeks. There is no concensus regarding treatment between 32-34 weeks. Corticosteroid therapy is not recommended before 24 weeks.

Advantage:

Steroids reduce the rate of respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage and necrotising enterocolitis in the newborn.
The effect of treatment is maximal between 24 hours of the first dose and uptil 7 days.
Earlier it was recommended to give repeated doses weekly till the patient delivers but this practice is associated with significant fetal and neonatal side effects like cerebral palsy and should be abandoned.
Betamethasone is the steroid of choice as it also prevents periventricular leukomalacia although dexamethasone can also be used.

The vascular endothelial cells also deform, increasing vascular permeability. The vasodilatation and increased endothelial permeability is mediated by histamine, PGE2, and prostacyclin as well as growth factor VEGF (vascular endothelial cell growth factor).

Low-density human lipoprotein not only contains the greatest ratio of bound cholesterol to protein but also has the greatest potency in suppressing endogenous cholesterogenesis. normally suppress cholesterol synthesis by binding to a specific membrane receptor that mediates inhibition of hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG) coenzyme A reductase. In familial hypercholesterolemia the LDL receptor is dysfunctional, with the result that cholesterol synthesis is less responsive to plasma cholesterol levels. Suppression of HMG CoA reductase is attained using inhibitors (statins) that mimic the structure of mevalonic acid, the natural feedback inhibitor of the enzyme. Note: The LDL (apoB-100, E) receptor is defective in familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic condition in which blood LDL cholesterol levels are increased, causing premature atherosclerosis.

True about protooncogene-,,"A proto-oncogene is a normal gene that could become an oncogene due to mutations or increased expression. Proto-oncogenes code for proteins that help to regulate cell growth and differentiation. Proto-oncogenes are often involved in signal transduction and execution of mitogenic signals, usually through their protein products. Upon acquiring an activating mutation, a proto-oncogene becomes a tumor-inducing agent, an oncogene. Examples of proto-oncogenes include RAS, WNT, MYC, ERK, and TRK. The MYC gene is implicated in Burkitt's Lymphoma, which stas when a chromosomal translocation moves an enhancer sequence within the vicinity of the MYC gene. The MYC gene codes for widely used transcription factors. When the enhancer sequence is wrongly placed, these transcription factors are produced at much higher rates. Another example of an oncogene is the Bcr-Abl gene found on the Philadelphia Chromosome, a piece of genetic material seen in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia caused by the translocation of pieces from chromosomes 9 and 22.

F.S. Merkel referred to these cells as Tastzellen or ""touch cells"" Merkel cells are found in the skin and some parts of the mucosa (stratum germinativum) of all vertebrates. In mammalian skin, they are clear cells found in the stratum basale (at the bottom of sweat duct ridges) of the epidermis approximately 10 pm in diameter. They also occur in epidermal invaginations of the plantar foot surface called rete ridges. Most often, they are associated with sensory nerve endings, when they are known as Merkel nerve endings (Merkel cell-neurite complex). They are associated with slowly adapting (SA1) somatosensory nerve fibers. They are associated with the sense of light touch discrimination of shapes and textures.

Absense of taste sensation is termed as:,,"(B) Ageusia # Ageusia is the loss of taste functions of the tongue, particularly the inability to detect sweetness, sourness, bitterness, saltiness, and umami (the taste of monosodium glutamate). It is sometimes confused for anosmia--a loss of the sense of smell. Because the tongue can only indicate texture and differentiate between sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami most of what is perceived as the sense of taste is actually derived from smell. True aguesia is relatively rare compared to hypogeusia--a partial loss of taste--and dysgeusia--a distortion or alteration of taste.> Causes of Ageusia:> Neurological damage: Tissue damage to the nerves that support the tongue can cause ageusia, especially damage to the lingual nerve and the glossopharyngeal nerve.> Neurological disorders such as Bell's palsy, Familial dysautonomia, and Multiple sclerosis cause similar problems to nerve dam- age, as do certain infectious conditions like primary amoeboid meningoencephalopathy. The lingual nerve (which is a branch of the trigeminal V3 nerve, but carries taste sensation back to the chorda tympani nerve to the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve) can also be damaged during otologic surgery, causing a feeling of metal taste.> Problems with the endocrine system:> Deficiency of vitamin B3 (Niacin) and zinc can cause problems with the endocrine system, which may cause taste loss or alteration. Disorders of the endocrine system, such as Cushing's syndrome, hypothyroidism and diabetes mellitus, can cause similar problems.> Ageusia can also be caused by medicinal side-effects from antirheumatic drugs such as penicillamine, antiproliferative drugs such as cisplatin, ACE inhibitors, and other drugs including azelastine, clarithromycin and zopiclone.> Other causes:> Local damage and inflammation that interferes with the taste buds or local nervous system such as that stemming from radiation therapy, glossitis, tobacco abuse, and denture use also cause ageusia.

PCo2 is most impoant input regulating magnitude of ventilation under resting conditions. Changes in alveolar ventilation have immediate, pronounced effect on aerial Pco2 (unlike Po2). Even slight alterations from normal Pco2 induce significant reflex. Increased Pco2 increases ventilation. Blood Brain Barrier is permeable to Co2, so increased aerial Pco2 increases brain ECF Pco2 and , it stimulates central chemoreceptors which increases ventilation by stimulating respiratory centers. Regulation of respiration: The rhythmic discharges from the brain that produce spontaneous respiration are regulated by alterations in aerial Po2, PCo2, and H+ concentration. There are numerous factors that affect and control ventilation. Chemical control Co2 ( CSF and brain interstitial fluid H+ concentration) o2 ( carotid and aoic bodies) H+ ( carotid and aoic bodies) Nonchemical control Vagal afferents from receptors in the airways and lungs Afferents from the pons, hypothalamus, and limbic system Afferents from proprioceptors Afferents from baroreceptors: aerial, atrial, ventricular, pulmonary Preipheral (Carotid & Aoic) Chemoreceptors: The carotid bodies are located at the bifurcation of common carotid aery. They send afferents in the carotid sinus nerve to the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) the aoic bodies are located between the arch of aoa and pulmonary aery afferents ascend in the recurrent laryngeal nerves to the vagus (X). Stimulation results from a decrease in carotid and aoic body tissue PO2. Central Chemoreceptors: situated near (beneath) the ventral surface of the medulla, near the origins of the vagi and glossopharyngeal nerves these are anatomically separate from the respiratory centres, and are bathed in brain ECF.

Congenitally abnormal hemoglobin: Hemoglobin M Hemoglobin M is passed as an autosomal dominant trait affecting either the alpha or beta chain of hemoglobin; homozygous Hb M affecting both alpha and beta chains is incompatible with life. Amino acid substitution (often a tyrosine for histidine) near the heme iron facilitates iron oxidation. 2. Inherited enzyme deficiencies: NADH-dependent cytochrome b5 -reductase and cytochrome bc deficiency. Deficiency of either cytochrome b5 or its reducing enzyme, cytochrome b5-reductase, decreases reduction of MetHb back to Hb 3. Nitrite (NO2), other oxidants and oxygen-reducing compounds Nitrites are a common oxidizing source of MetHb production. Reducing agents paradoxically produce methemoglobinemia by reducing oxygen to a free radical or water to 1-1,O2, which then oxidizes hemoglobin. 4. ""Sensitive"" hemoglobin: Blue baby syndrome Bacteria in the immature gastrointestinal tracts of infants conve nitrate (NO3) to the powerful oxidant nitrite (NO,).

The goal of NRR=1 can be best achieved by use of following contraceptive methods -,,"Sterilization is the most effective contraception to achieve NRR =1 Male sterilization Male sterilization or vasectomy being a comparatively* simple operation can be performed even in primary health centres by trained doctors under local anaesthesia. When carried out under strict aseptic technique, it should have no risk of moality. In vasectomy, it is customary to remove a piece of vas at least 1 cm after clamping. The ends are ligated and then folded back on themselves and sutured into position, so that the cut ends face away from each other. This will reduce the risk of recanalization at a later date. It is impoant to stress that the acceptor is not immediately sterile after the operation, usually until approximately 30 ejaculations have taken place. During this intermediate period, another method of contraception must be used. If properly performed, vasectomies are almost 100 per cent effective. Following vasectomy, sperm production and hormone output are not affected. The sperm produced are destroyed intraluminally by phagocytosis. This is a normal process in the male genital tract, but the rate of destruction is greatly increased after vasectomy. Vasectomy is a simpler, faster and less expensive operation than tubectomy in terms of instruments, hospitalization and doctor's training. Cost-wise, the ratio is about 5 vasectomies to one tubal ligation. Ref: Park 25th edition Pgno : 543",general_faq

A histological section of the left ventricle of a deceased 28-year-old male shows classic contraction band necrosis of the myocardium. Biological specimens confirm the presence of cocaine and metabolites. Activity of which of the following enzymes was most likely increased in the patient's myocardial cells sholy prior to his death?,,"Cocaine causes contraction band necrosis by blocking the reuptake of norepinephrine, resulting in excessive vasoconstriction of coronary vessels, leading to ischemia and infarction of hea tissue. Under these pathological conditions, myocardial cells switch to anaerobic metabolism and therefore glycolysis becomes the sole source of ATP substrate-level phosphorylations by phosphoglycerate kinase and pyruvate kinase. Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) is the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, and its activity would therefore be increased. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase is a regulatory enzyme in gluconeogenesis, which is induced by coisol, epinephrine, and glucagon. It functions in the hepatic synthesis of glucose when energy levels from beta-oxidation of fatty acids are adequate. Pyruvate dehydrogenase produces acetyl-CoA from pyruvate and coenzyme A, bridging glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. It requires 5 cofactors, including NAD and FAD, which would no longer be produced by the electron transpo under hypoxic conditions, decreasing its activity. Succinate dehydrogenase is a key enzyme of the Krebs cycle, producing a reduced equivalent of FAD to feed into the electron transpo chain. It is also known as Complex II. The Krebs cycle only functions if oxygen is in appropriate concentrations since it is regulated by the levels of NADH, which is only consumed by the electron transpo chain if there is enough oxygen. The absence of oxygen leads to an accumulation of NADH and a subsequent decrease in the enzyme activities of the Krebs cycle. Ref: Bender D.A., Mayes P.A. (2011). Chapter 20.

The chemical activity of a kinase involves transferring a phosphate group from a nucleoside triphosphate (usually ATP) and covalently attaching it to one of three amino acids that have a free hydroxyl group.Most kinases act on both serine and threonine, others act on tyrosine, and a number (dual specificity kinases) act on all three.

(Ref: Gastrointestinal Imaging: The Requisites By Giles W. Boland 4th ed page 2)Careful endoscopic assessment at the end of any procedure combined with a chest X-ray will identify many cases of perforation immediately. If not recognised immediately, then early and late suspected perforations should be assessed by a water-soluble contrast swallow. If this is negative, a dilute barium swallow should be considered. A CT scan can be used to replace a contrast swallow or as an adjunct to accurately delineate specific fluid collections. (Bailey 25th ed page 1015)Diagnosis of an esophageal perforation may be made radiographically. A chest roentgenogram may demonstrate a hydropneumothorax. A contrast esophagram is done using barium for a suspected thoracic perforation and Gastrografin for an abdominal perforation. Barium is inert in the chest but causes peritonitis in the abdomen, whereas aspirated Gastrografin can cause life-threatening pneumonitis. A surgical endoscopy needs to be performed if the esophagram is negative or if operative intervention is planned. (Ref: Sabiston 18th ed chapter 41)",general_faq

"In post-hepatic jaundice, the concentration of conjugated bilirubin in the blood is higher than that of unconjugated bilirubin because -",,"Jaundice

Jaundice is not a disease but rather a sign that can occur in many different diseases.
Jaundice is the yellowish staining of skin and sclerae which is caused by the high level of blood bilirubin.
On the basis of etiology, jaundice can be divided into 3 types : -

1. Prehepatic jaundice

Prehepatic jaundice is due to increased production of bilirubin which results in an increased bilirubin load presented to the liver.
The liver is normal and is able to conjugate the bilirubin at a normal rate; However, due to overproduction of bilirubin, conjugation capacity of the liver is overwhelmed and unconjugated bilirubin is increased → Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
Prehepatic jaundice is caused by hemolysis, i.e., hemolytic anemia due to any cause, e.g., hereditary spherocytosis, Thalassemia, SCA, Malaria, Drugs (methyldopa, quinine) etc.

2. Hepatic jaundice

Here the cause lies within the hepatocytes which have either a defect in the conjugation process or in the excretion of conjugated bilirubin into the bile.
This type of jaundice is caused by all causes of hepatitis (infection, alcohol, drugs, toxin or autoimmune); in congenital hyperbilirubenemias; and in cirrhosis.

3. Post hepatic (extrahepatic) jaundice

Which of the following regulates lipolysis in adipocytes?,,"Ans. B. Activation of triglyceride lipase as a result of hormone-stimulated increases in cyclic AMP levelsa. Lipolysis is directly regulated by hormones in adipocytes. Epinephrine stimulates adenylate cyclase to produce cyclic AMP, which in turn stimulates a protein kinase.b. The kinase activates triglyceride lipase by phosphorylating it. Lipolysis then proceeds and results in the release of free fatty acids and glycerol.c. A futile re esterification of free fatty acids is prevented, since adipocytes contain little glycerol kinase to phosphorylate the liberated glycerol, which must be processed in the liver. Inhibition of lipolysis occurs in the presence of insulin, which lowers cyclic AMP levels. Lipoprotein lipase is not an adipocyte enzyme.",general_faq

Type II respiratory failure best relates to which of the following?,,"TYPE II RESPIRATORY FAILUREThis type of respiratory failure is a consequence of alveolar hypoventilation and results from the inability to eliminate carbon dioxide effectively. Mechanisms are categorized by Impaired central nervous system (CNS) drive to breathe (drug overdose, brainstem injury, sleep-disordered breathing, and severe hypothyroidism), Impaired strength with failure of neuromuscular function in the respiratory system. Reduced strength can be due to impaired neuromuscular transmission (e.g., myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) or respiratory muscle weakness (e.g., myopathy, electrolyte derangements, fatigue).Increased load(s) on the respiratory system. The overall load on the respiratory system can be subclassified into Resistive loads (e.g., bronchospasm), Loads due to reduced lung compliance (e.g., alveolar edema, atelectasis, intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure --see below), Loads due to reduced chest wall compliance (e.g., pneumothorax, pleural effusion, abdominal distention), and ads due to increased minute ventilation requirements (e.g., pulmonary embolus with increased dead-space fraction, sepsis).Ref: Harrison 19e pg: 1732",general_faq

They may also cause mutations in the gene into which they insert or alter the expression of nearby genes.* In contrast to plasmids or bacterial viruses, transposons cannot replicate independently of the recipient DNA. More than one transposon can be located in the DNA for example, resistance genes. Thus, transposons can jump from:# The host genomic DNA to a plasmid# One plasmid to another# A plasmid to genomic DNA.* An insertion sequence is a short DNA sequence that acts as a simple transposable element. Insertion sequences have two major characteristics: they are small relative to other transposable elements (generally around 700 to 2500bp in length) and only code for proteins implicated in the transposition activity (they are thus different from other transposons, which also carry accessory genes such as antibiotic resistance genes.",general_faq

Max risk of stroke after TIA:,,"Ans. a. First 48 hoursTransient ischemic attack (TIA) is sudden, transitory loss of neurologic function that comes on without headache and resolves spontaneously within 24 hours (but usually lasts less than 1 hour), leaving no neurologic sequelae.The specific symptoms depend on the area of the brain affected, which is in turn related to the vessels involved. The most common origin is high-grade stenosis (>=70%) of the internal carotid, or ulcerated plaque at the carotid bifurcation.Stroke may be indistinguishable from a TIA at the time of presentation: Duration of symptoms is the determining difference.Symptoms are transient with a TIA because reperfusion occurs, either because of collateral circulation or because of the breaking up of an embolus.The blockage in blood flow does not last long enough to cause permanent infarction.Once a patient has a TIA, there is a high risk of stroke in 10-15% in the first 3 months, with most events occurring in the first 2 days. The risk of a stroke in a patient with a history of TIA is about 10% per year. TIAs carry a 30% 5-year risk of stroke. Therefore, cardiac risk factors should be closely investigated and, if possible, eliminated in a patient who has had a TIA.Cases may present only with transient loss of vision in one eye, known as amaurosis fugax. This happens during a transient ischemic attack because the first branch of the internal carotid artery is the ophthalmic artery.Note:TIAs are never due to hemorrhage; hemorrhages do not resolve in 24 hours.The importance of TIAs is that they are predictors of stroke, and timely elective carotid endarterectomy may prevent or minimize that possibility.Workup starts with.noninvasive Duplex studies.Carotid endarterectomy is indicated if the lesions are found in the location that explains the neurologic symptoms.Angioplasty and stent can be performed in high risk surgical patients",general_faq

Oral/sublingual route is preferred. 1 mg is given at half hour intervals till relief is obtained or a total of 6 mg is given. Parenteral administration, though rapid in action is more hazardous.
Ergotamine acts by constricting the dilated cranial vessels and/or by specific constriction of carotid A-V shunt channels. Ergotamine and DHE have also been shown to reduce neurogenic inflammation and leakage of plasma in duramater that occurs due to retrograde stimulation of periascular afferent nerves.

Right-sided cardiac decompensation leads to passive congestion of the liver.
The liver is slightly enlarged, tense, and cyanotic, with rounded edges.
Microscopically there is congestion of centrilobular sinusoids.
With time, centrilobular hepatocytes become atrophic, resulting in markedly attenuated liver cell plates.
Left-sided cardiac failure or shock may lead to hepatic hypoperfusion & hypoxia, causing ischemic coagulative necrosis of hepatocytes in the central region of the lobule (centrilobular necrosis).

The patient is eventually diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1. The protein that is mutated in this disorder normally does which of the following functions?",,"The normal function of NF1 is to promote the intrinsic GTPase function of the RAS oncogene. Mechanism:- RAS has an intrinsic GTPase activity that is accelerated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which bind to active RAS and augment its GTPase activity by more than 1000-fold, thereby terminating signal transduction. Thus, GAPs prevent uncontrolled RAS activity. When the Ras protein is bound to GTP, the growth-promoting function of the molecule is ""ON"". On hydrolysis of the GTP to GDP, Ras is conveed to an inactive state. GAPs (GTPase Activating Proteins), such as NF-1, suppress cell growth by stimulating GTP hydrolysis. Disabling mutations of neurofibromin 1, a GAP (GTPase-activating protein) encoded by the NF1 gene, are associated with the inherited cancer syndrome familial neurofibromatosis type 1. NF1 is therefore an example of a tumor suppressor gene that acts through negative regulation of RAS signaling (inhibitor of RAS/MAPK signaling).

A simple way of explaining this observation is to use the idea that ApoB-100 reflects lipoprotein particle number (independent of their cholesterol content).

Serious cardiac arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes, QT interval prolongation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation, have been repoed in patients taking cisapride with medications that inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4. Examples of medications other than cisapride that have a similar interaction with erythromycin include ketoconazole, fluconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, and indinavir. It is impoant to note that QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, cardiac arrest, and sudden death have occurred in patients taking only cisapride. None of the other agents listed interact with erythromycin to produce these proarrhythmic effects. Famotidine is an H2 receptor antagonist used in the treatment of GERD and gastric ulcers; this agent is generally well tolerated with very little incidence of drug interactions. Lansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor indicated for the treatment of gastric ulcerations and GERD.

An old lady was brought to the ER in an unconscious state. She has a history of previous such attacks in the past months. An ECG was done and the graph obtained is given below. Which of the following is most probable cause?,,"Ans. D. 2:1 blockElectrocardiography and Electrophysiology of AV conduction blockAV conduction block typically is diagnosed electrocardiographically, which characterizes the severity of the conduction disturbances and allows one to draw inferences about the location of the block. AV conduction block manifests as slow conduction in its mildest forms and failure to conduct, either intermittent of persistently, in more severe varieties.a. First degree AV block (PR interval >200ms) is a slowing of conduction through the AV junction. The site of delay is typically in the AV node but may be in the atria, bundle of his, or his Purkinje system. A wide QRS is suggestive of delay in the AV node proper or less commonly in the bundle of His. In second degree AV block there is an intermittent failure of electrical impulse conduction from atrium to ventricle.b. Second degree AV block is sub classified as Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) or Mobitz type II. The periodic failure of conduction in Mobitz, type I block is characterized by a progressively lengthening PR interval, shortening of the RR interval, and a pause that is less than the two times the immediately preceding RR interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG). The ECG complex after the pause exhibits a shorter PR interval than that immediately preceding the pause. This ECG pattern most often arises because of decremental conduction of electrical impulses in the AV node.",general_faq

"A 6 year old female patient complains of pain due to a decayed lower right 2nd molar. She has a history of unpleasant dental extraction with the lower left second molar. On seeing the dentist, the child immediately cries and withdraws. Which theory of child psychology best explains the reaction of the patient?",,"Classical conditioning (1927) occurs readily with young children and can have a considerable impact on a young child's behavior on the first visit to a dental office. By the time a child is brought for the first visit to a dentist, even if that visit is at an early age, it is highly likely that he or she will have had many experiences with pediatricians and medical personnel. When a child experiences pain, the reflex reaction is crying and withdrawal. In Pavlovian terms, the infliction of pain is an unconditioned stimulus, but a number of aspects of the setting in which the pain occurs can come to be associated with this unconditioned stimulus. For instance, it is unusual for a child to encounter people who are dressed entirely in white uniforms or long white coats. If the unconditioned stimulus of painful treatment comes to be associated with the conditioned stimulus of white coats, a child may cry and withdraw immediately at the first sight of a white-coated dentist or dental assistant. In this case, the child has learned to associate the conditioned stimulus of pain and the unconditioned stimulus of a white-coated adult, and the mere sight of the white coat is enough to produce the reflex behavior initially associated with pain
Note: A) Acquisition – learning a new experience (fear of dentist/whitecoat/needles)
           B) Generalization – generalizing all similar stimuli (all those wearing white coat cause pain)
           C) Discrimination – differentiating individual stimuli ( not everyone who wears white coat causes pain)
           D) Extinction - disappearance of the acquired experience ( loss of fear of dental procedures)
           E) Spontaneous recovery – reappearance of extinct response ( fear of dental procedure reappears due to poor management behaviour strategies).",symptoms_diagnosis

This dis- order is encountered largely in persons of Armenian, Sephardic Jewish, and Arabic origins. It is associated with widespread tissue involvement indistinguishable from reactive systemic amyloidosis. The amyloid fibril proteins are made up of AA proteins, suggesting that this form of amyloidosis is related to the recurrent bouts of inflamma- tion that characterize this disease. The gene for familial Mediterranean fever is called pyrin and encodes a protein that is a component of the inflammasome (Chapter 2). Patients have gain-of-function mutations in pyrin that result in constitutive overproduction of the pro- inflammatory cytokine IL-1 and persistent inflammation. In contrast with familial Mediterranean fever, a group of autosomal dominant familial disorders is characterized by deposition of amyloid predominantly in the peripheral and autonomic nerves. These familial amyloidotic poly- neuropathies have been described in kindreds in different pas of the world--for example, in Pougal, Japan, Sweden, and the United States. As mentioned previously, the fibrils in these familial polyneuropathies are made up of mutant forms of transthyretin (ATTRs).",general_faq

Thromboangitis obliterans occurs almost exclusively among heavy-cigarrete-smoking persons. It is more common in men but incidence is increasing in women because of increasing smoking habit in women. o Buerger disease is associated with HLA B-5 and HLA-A9. In thrombongitis obliterans there is acute and chronic segmental inflammation of vessels with accompanied thrombosis in the lumen. Typically, the thrombus contains microabscesses with a central focus of neutrophils surrounded by gran u lomatous inflammation. Later, the inflammatory process extends into contiguous veins and nerves and in time all three structures (aeries, veins and nerves) become encased in fibrous tissue, a characterstic that is very rare with other form of vasculitis. Clinical manifestations Thrombangitis obliterans affects vessels of upper and lower extremities. Symptoms are due to vascular insufficiency, i.e. Ischemia of toes, feet and fingers that can lead to ulcer and frank gangrene.

Regarding Chronic Viral Hepatitis -,,"Classification of hepatitis

In the new classification system of Hepatitis, Grading refers to the assessment of necroinflammatory activity.
Chronic hepatitis represents a series of liver disorders of varying causes and severity in which hepatic inflammation and necrosis continue for at least 6 months.
Earlier chronic hepatitis was categorized into three types depending upon histopathological features. These are


Chronic persistent hepatitis
Chronic lobular hepatitis
Chronic active hepatitis


Now, this categorization has been replaced by more informative classification based upon a combination of clinical serological and histological variables.
Now the classification is based upon —


It's cause
Its histologic activity or grade
It's a degree of progression or stage

(a) Classification by cause —

In this, the hepatitis is classified according to the cause - such as viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, drug-associated hepatitis.

(b) Classification by Grade —

This classification is based upon an assessment of necroinflammatory activity.
An assessment of following histological features is made on liver biopsy -
Periportal necrosis
Piecemeal necrosis
Bridging necrosis
Portal inflammation

(c) Classification by stage —

This classification is based upon the degree of fibrosis.
It reflects the levels of progression of the disease.
Staging is based upon the degree of fibrosis as follows

0 = No fibrosis
1= Mild fibrosis (limited to portal tract)
2 = Moderate fibrosis (Portal and periportal fibrosis)
3 = Severe fibrosis including bridging fibrosis
4 = Cirrhosis",general_faq

Thus detecting the presence of air in stomach and intestine (positive test) proves live bih (even in absence of positive hydrostatic lung test if there had been some obstruction in respiratory However, negative test (absence of air in stomach and bowel) does not always mean still-bih since air does not necessarily enter stomach in adequate amounts during act of breathing. Procedure: The stomach and intestine are removed separately after tying double ligature at each end, place them both in water. They float in water if respiration has taken place, otherwise they will sink No medicolegal value Because air may be swallowed by child in attempting to free the air passage of fluid obstruction in case of still-bih. It is useless in putrefaction Other Tests in Infanticide For Lungs Static test or Fodere's testa: Weight of lung before (30-40 g) and after 66 gm) is measured. The increase in weight of lung is due to increased blood flow Ploucquet's testa: Weight of lung is doubled after respiration (Before respiration-1/70 of body weight, after respiration-1/35 of body weight) Hydrostatic test (Raygat's test)a: It is based on a fact that on breathing, the volume of lungs is increased, which more than compensates the weight of additional blood, due to which their specific gravity is diminished. For Middle Ear Werdin's test: Before bih, the middle ear contains gelatinous embryonic connective tissue.

Any factor that results in deficiency of vit B12 or folic acid will lead to defective DNA synthesis. Inadequate DNA synthesis results in defective nuclear maturation. However, the synthesis of RNA and proteins is not altered, so cytoplasmic maturation proceeds in advance of nuclear maturation - Nuclear/Cytoplasmic asynchrony that results in formation of megaloblasts.Important causes of megaloblastic anemiaVitamin BJ2 deficiency* Decrease intake: Inadequate diet, vegetarianism.* Impaired absorption : Intrinsic factor deficiency (pernicious anemia, gastrectomy), intestinal diseases (crohn's disease, ileitis, ileal resection, lymphoma, systemic sclerosis), fish tapeworm infestation (D. latum), blind loop syndrome (bacterial overgrowth), diverticuli of bowel, chronic pancreatitis.* Increased requirment: Pregnancy, hyperthyroidism, disseminated cancer.Folate deficiency* Decrease intake: Inadequate diet, alcoholism, infancy.* Impaired absorption : Malabsorption state, intestinal diseases.* Increased requirment: Pregnancy, infancy, disseminated cancer.* Others : Hemodialysis, antifolate drugs (methotrexate, phenobarbitone, phenytoin, trimethoprim, primidone, triametrene, azathioprine.Rare causes* These are : Hereditary orotic aciduria, hypothyroidism, Di-Gueglielmo syndrome, congenital dyserythropoietic anemia, thiamine and pyridoxine deficiency.",general_faq

Complication of blood transfusion can be all except -,,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Metabolic acidosis The question is most probably about complications of massive blood transfusion.Massive Blood Transfusion * Massive blood transfusion is generally defined as transfusion of one to two volumes of patient's own blood volumes (For most adults that is equivalent to 10-20 units.)Complications of Massive Blood TransfusionCoagulopathyThe most common cause of bleeding following massive blood transfusion is dilutional thrombocytopeniaClinically significant dilution of the coagulation factors is unusual in previously normal individuals.Citrate ToxicityCitrate is used as an anticoagulant in the stored blood.Citrate has a property to bind calcium, this calcium binding by the citrate preservative can become significant following transfusion of large volumes of blood or blood products.Hypocalcemia results in some patients after massive transfusion, to prevent this, the transfusion rate should not exceed 1 unit every 5 minutes.Citrate also has an affinity for magnesium ion and the occurrence of hypomagnesemia in the setting of massive transfusion is seen (rarely).HypothermiaBlood is stored at a temperature of 2degC-6degC. So massive blood transfusion can result in hypothermia.Massive blood transfusion is an absolute indication for warming all blood products and intravenous fluids to normal body temperature.Hypothermia due to massive transfusion can result in ventricular arrhythmia.Acid-Base BalanceThe stored blood is acidic for two reasons.Due to the citric acid (the anticoagulants) Due to release of metabolic products by the anaerobic glycolysis of red cells (CO2 and Lactate).Despite the Stored Blood Being Acidic, Significant metabolic acidosis due to transfusion is not common.- Once the resuscitation is complete and normal perfusion is restored, any metabolic acidosis present, typically resolves, and progressive metabolic alkalosis supervenes as citrate and lactate contained in transfusion and resuscitation fluids are converted to bicarbonate by the liver. The most consistent acid base abnormality after massive blood transfusion is postoperative metabolic alkalosis.Serum Potassium ConcentrationThe extracellular concentration of Potassium in stored blood steadily increases with time due to lysis of RBC's.The amount of extracellular potassium transfused with each unit is typically less than 4m Eq per unit. Hyperkalemia can develop regardless of the age of the blood when transfusion rate exceeded 100ml/min.Oxygen Affinity Changes * 2, 3 DPG is greatly reduced in RBC's after about 3 weeks of storage, this increases hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen and adversely affects oxygen delivery to tissues.Acute Respiration?

The infection is transmitted from animals to humans. Brucella abous (cattle), B suis (hogs), and B melitensis (goats) are the main agents. Transmission to humans occurs by contact with infected meat (slaughterhouse workers), placentae of infected animals (farmers, veterinarians), or ingestion of infected unpasteurized milk or cheese. The incubation period varies from a few days to several weeks. Brucellosis is a systemic infection that may become chronic. B. melitensis infections tend to be more severe and prolonged, whereas those caused by B. abous are more self-limited. After an incubation period of 1 to 3 weeks, nonspecific symptoms such as fever, chills, fatigue, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss occur. The onset can be acute or gradual. The undulating (rising-and-falling) fever pattern that gives the disease its name occurs in a minority of patients. The treatment of choice is tetracycline plus rifampin. Prevention of brucellosis involves pasteurization of milk, immunization of animals, and slaughtering of infected animals. There is no human vaccine. Ref: Levinson W. (2012). Chapter 20.

Pathogenesis of panacinar emphysemao Panacinar emphysema is associated with congenital deficiency of a1.-antitrypsin.o This results in unchecked overactivity of neutrophil elastase that causes destruction of alveolar wall,o As a,-antitrypsin is deficient throughout the acinus, the acini are uniformly involved from the respiratoiy bronchiole to the terminal blind alveoli.o Neutrophils are the major cells in the pathogenesis of panacinar emphysemaB. Pathogenesis of centriacinar emphysemao Centriacinar emphysema is associated with smoking.o Nicotine acts as a direct chemoattractant for neutrophils and macrophages,o So, in centriacinar emphysema, both neutrophils and macrophages play central role,o Smoking enhances activity of neutrophil and macrophage elastase.o Macrophage elastase is not inhibited by a1-antitrypsin and indeed can proteolvticallv digest this antiprotease,o Beside protease - antiprotease mechanism, oxidant - antioxidant imbalance also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of smoking related emphysema.o Normally, the lung contains a healthy complement of antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, glutathione),o Tobacco smoke contains abundant reactive oxygen species (free radicals) which deplete these antioxidant mechanisms.o Free radicals cause tissue damage as well as they inactivate a(-antitrypsin, resulting in functional a,- antitrypsin deficiency even in patients without enzyme deficiency.",general_faq

True about meningiomas-,,"Meningiomas are predominantly benign tumors that arise from arachnoid meningothelial cells. They usually occur in adults and are often attached to the dura. Meningiomas may be found along any of the external surfaces of the brain as well as within the ventricular system, where they arise from the stromal arachnoid cells of the choroid plexus.They usually come to attention because of vague nonlocalizing symptoms, or with focal findings referable to compression of the adjacent brain. Most meningiomas are easily separable from the underlying brain. Meningiomas (WHO grade I/IV) grow as well-defined dura-based masses that may compress the brain but do notinvade it. Among the varied histologic patterns are syncytial, named for whorled clusters of cells without visible cell membranes that sit in tight groups; fibroblastic, with elongated cells and abundant collagen deposition between them; transitional, which shares features of the syncytial and fibroblastic types; psammomatous, with numerous psammoma bodies ; and secretary, with gland-like PAS-positive eosinophilic secretions known as pseudopsammoma bodies. Atypical meningiomas (WHO grade II/IV) are recognized by the presence of ceain histologic features (prominent nucleoli, increased cellularity, pattern-less growth), and often have a higher mitotic rate.

Tumorogenesis in aging is due to -,,"After a fixed number of divisions, normal cells becomes arrested in a terminally nondividing state.
How does the normal cells count their divisions i.e. How, do the cells find out that now they do'nt need to divide further.

Cells achieve this through telomer shortening 

Telomers are short repeated sequences of DNA present at the linear ends of chromosome that are important for ensuring complete replication of chromosome ends.
It consists of many arrays of TTAGGG repeats at tellninal of 3' ending strand. It confers stability to chromosomes. With each successive division there is some shortening of the telomers.
Once the telomers are shortened beyond a certain point the ends of the chromosome are seen as broken i1 NA, which signals cell cycle arrest.
The broken NA leads to activation of p53 dependent cell cycle check points causing proliferative arrest or apoptosis.
Thus telomere shortening functions as a clock that counts cell division.
	How do the germ cells keep on dividing throughout their life???
In germ cells telomere shortening is prevented by the sustained function of the enzyme telomerase.
Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase and is responsible for telomer synthesis and maintaining the length of telomer.
It is RNA dependent DNA polymerase. It has one segment that is complimentary to TTAGGG repeat and is used as template for the replication of telomeric sequence.
This enzyme is absent from most somatic cells and hence they suffer progressive loss of telomers and they exit the cell cycle. Telomerase is present in Germ cells thus explaining the ability of these cells to self replicate extensively. If loss of telomere is the basis of finite life span then how do cancer cells continue to divide actively????
In cancer cells telomerase activity is reactivated. Telomerase activity has been detected in more than 90% of human tumours.
Thus telomerase activity and maintenance of telomere length are essential for the replicative potential in cancer cells.",general_faq

Which dietary deficiency of a vitamin can cause Pellagra.,,"Some amino acids (isoleucine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine) are both glucogenic and ketogenic because their degradation pathway forms multiple products.a. Amino acids that are converted to pyruvate (see Figure I).(1). The amino acids that are synthesized from the intermediates of glycolysis (serine, glycine, cysteine, and alanine) are degraded to form pyruvate.(a). Serine is converted to 2-phosphoglycerate, an intermediate of glycolysis, or directly to pyruvate and NH4+ by serine dehydratase, an enzyme that requires PLP.(b). Glycine, in a reversal of the reaction utilized for its synthesis, reacts with methylene-FH4 to form serine.1. Glycine also reacts with FH4 and NAD+ to produce CO2 and NH4+ (glycine cleavage enzyme).2. Glycine can be converted to glyoxylate, which can be oxidized to CO2 and H2 O or converted to oxalate.(c). Cysteine forms pyruvate. Its sulfur, which was derived from methionine, is converted to H2 SO4 , which is excreted by the kidneys.(d). Alanine can be transaminated to pyruvate.b. Amino acids that are converted to intermediates of the TCA cycle (see Figure II).(1). The carbons from the four groups of amino acids form the TCA cycle intermediates: a-ketoglutarate, succinyl-CoA, fumarate, and oxaloacetate.(a). Amino acids that form a-ketoglutarate (see Figure III).1. Glutamate can be deaminated by glutamate dehydrogenase or transaminated to form a- ketoglutarate.2. Glutamine is converted by glutaminase to glutamate with the release of its amide nitrogen as NH4+ 3. Proline is oxidized so that its ring opens, forming glutamate semialdehyde, which is oxidized to glutamate.4. Arginine is cleaved by arginase in the liver to form urea and ornithine. Ornithine is transaminated to glutamate semialdehyde, which is oxidized to glutamate.5. Histidine is converted to formiminoglutamate (FIGLU). The formimino group is transferred to FH4, and the remaining five carbons form glutamate.(b). Amino acids that form succinyl-CoA (see Figure IV)1. Four amino acids are converted to propionyl-CoA, which is carboxylated in a biotin requiring reaction to form methylmalonyl-CoA, which is rearranged to form succinyl-CoA in a reaction that requires vitamin B12 (seen previously in the metabolism of odd-chain number fatty acids).a). Threonine is converted by a dehydratase to NH4+ and a-ketobutyrate, which is oxidatively decarboxylated to propionyl-CoA.In a different set of reactions, threonine is converted to glycine and acetyl-CoA.b). Methionine provides methyl groups for the synthesis of various compounds; its sulfur is incorporated into cysteine; and the remaining carbons form succinyl-CoA.i. Methionine and ATP form S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which donates a methyl group and forms homocysteine.ii. Homocysteine is reconverted to methionine by accepting a methyl group from the FH4 pool via vitamin B12 .iii. Homocysteine can also react with serine to form cystathionine. The cleavage of cystathionine produces cysteine, NH4+ , and a-ketobutyrate, which is converted to propionyl-CoA.c). Valine and isoleucine, two of the three branched-chain amino acids, form succinyl-CoA (see Figure IV).i. The degradation of all the three branched-chain amino acids begins with a transamination followed by an oxidative decarboxylation catalysed by the branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (Figure V). This enzyme, like pyruvate dehydrogenase and a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, requires thiamine pyrophosphate, lipoic acid, CoA, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and NAD+.ii. Valine is eventually converted to succinyl-CoA via propionyl-CoA and methyl malonyl-CoA.iii. Isoleucine also forms succinyl-CoA after two of its carbons are released as acetyl-CoA.(c). Amino acids that form fumarate1. Three amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and aspartate) are converted to fumarate (see Figure II).a). Phenylalanine is converted to tyrosine by phenylalanine hydroxylase in a reaction requiring tetrahydrobiopterin and O2 (Figure VI).b). Tyrosine, obtained from the diet or by hydroxylation of phenylalanine, is converted to homogentisic acid. The aromatic ring is opened and cleaved, forming fumarate and acetoacetate.c). Aspartate is converted to fumarate via reactions of the urea cycle and the purine nucleotide cycle.d). Aspartate reacts with IMP to form AMP and fumarate in the purine nucleotide cycle.(d). Amino acids that form oxaloacetate (see Figure II)1. Aspartate is transaminated to form oxaloacetate.2. Asparagine loses its amide nitrogen as NH4+ , forming aspartate in a reaction catalyzed by asparaginase.c. Amino acids that are converted to acetyl-CoA or acetoacetate (see Figure VI).(1). Four amino acids (lysine, threonine, isoleucine, and tryptophan) can form acetyl-CoA, and phenylalanine and tyrosine form acetoacetate. Leucine is degraded to form both acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate.Pellagra is caused by a dietary deficiency of niacin, beriberi is caused by a lack of thiamine (vitamin B-,), scurvy caused by a lack of vitamin C, and rickets from a lack of vitamin D.I. Amino acids derived from the intermediates of glycolysis. These amino acids can be synthesized from glucose and can be reconverted to glucose in the liver.II. The degradation of amino acids. A. Amino acids that produce pyruvate or the intermediates of the TCA cycle. These amino acids are considered glucogenic because their carbons can produce glucose in the liver. B. Amino acids that produce acetyl-CoA or ketone bodies. These amino acids are considered ketogenic. CoA, coenzyme A; HMG-CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.III. Amino acids related through glutamate. These amino acids contain carbons that can be converted to glutamate, which can be converted to glucose in the liver. All of these amino acids except histidine can be synthesized from glucose.IV. Amino acids that can be converted to succinyl-CoA. The amino acids methionine, threonine, isoleucine, and valine, which form succinyl-CoA via methyl malonyl-CoA, are all essential. Because succinyl-CoA can form glucose, these amino acids are glucogenic. The carbons of serine are converted to cysteine and do not form succinyl-CoA by this pathway. A defect in cystathionine synthase causes homocystinuria. A defect in cystathionase causes cystathioninuria. B12-CH3, methyl cobalamin; N5-CH3-FH4, N 5- methyl tetrahydrofolate; PLP, pyridoxal phosphate; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.V. The degradation of the branched-chain amino acids.

"True regarding traumatic facial nerve palsy is all, except",,"TRAUMA TIC FACIAL NERVE PARALYSIS 1. FRACTURES OF TEMPORAL BONE Fractures of temporal bone may be longitudinal, transverse or mixed. Facial palsy is seen more often in transverse fractures (50%). Paralysis is due to intraneural haematoma, compression by a bony spicule or transection of nerve. In these cases, it is impoant to know whether paralysis was of immediate or delayed onset. Delayed onset paralysis is treated conservatively like Bell palsy while immediate onset paralysis may require surgery in the form of decompression, re-anastomosis of cut ends or cable nerve graft. 2. EAR OR MASTOID SURGERY Facial nerve is injured during stapedectomy, tympanoplasty or mastoid surgery. Paralysis may be immediate or delayed and treatment is the same as in temporal bone trauma. Sometimes, nerve is paralyzed due to pressure of packing on the exposed nerve and this should be relieved first. Operative injuries to facial nerve can be avoided if attention is paid to the following: (a) Anatomical knowledge of the course of facial nerve, possible variations and anomalies and its surgical landmarks. Cadaver dissections should be an impoant pa of the training in ear surgery. (b) Always working along the course of nerve and never across it. (c) Constant irrigation when drilling to avoid thermal injury. Use diamond burr when working near the nerve. (d) Gentle handling of the nerve when it is exposed, avoiding any pressure of instruments on the nerve. (e) Not to remove any granulations that penetrate the nerve. (f) Using magnification; never to work on facial nerve without an operating microscope. 3.

This multicenter randomized trial enrolled over 1400 patients with type 1 DM to either intensive or conventional diabetes management and prospectively evaluated the development of retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. The intensive group received multiple administrations of insulin daily along with education and psychological counseling. The intensive group achieved a mean hemoglobin A1C of 7.3% versus 9.1% in the conventional group. Improvement in glycemic control resulted in a 47% reduction in retinopathy, a 54% reduction in nephropathy, and a 60% reduction in neuropathy. There was a nonsignificant trend toward improvement in macrovascular complications. The results of the DCCT showed that individuals in the intensive group would attain up to 7 more years of intact vision and up to 5 more years free from lower limb amputation. Later, the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) studied over 5000 individuals with type 2 DM. Individuals receiving intensive glycemic control had a reduction in microvascular events but no significant change in macrovascular complications.

True about VSD are all except –,,"Hemodynamics of VSD

A VSD results in shunting of oxygenated blood from left to right because left ventricle has more pressure than right → Left to right shunt.
Blood flow from left to right ventricle due to high pressure gradient → Pansystolic murmur and systolic thrill.
Because left ventricle starts contracting before Right ventricle, pansystolic murmur starts early → Masking of Si.
This pressure gradient is maintained throughout the systole pansystolic murmur lasts long → Masking of S2.
Towards the end of systole, the declining left ventricular pressure becomes lower than aortic → Early closure of A2.
Left to right shunt occurs during systole at a time when the right ventricle is also contracting, therefore left to right shunt streams to pulmonary artery more or less directly → No volume overload > Right ventricle size remains normal.
Increased blood flow through pulmonary valve → Pulmonary ejection systolic murmur and delay & accentuated P2.
Early closure of A2 and delayed closure of P2 cause → Widely split S2 (But this is usually masked by pansystolic murmur).
Larger volume reaches the left atrium → Left atrial hypertrophy
Increased blood flow through mitral valve → Accentuated S1 (But it is masked by pansystolic murmur) and delayed diastolic murmur.

Ejection systolic murmur of pulmonary valve can not be separated from pansystolic murmur.
The effect of ejection systolic murmur is a selective transmission of pansystolic murmur to the upper left sternal border (pulmonary valve area) → In this area ejection characteristic of this murmur can be recognized since it does not mask the aortic component of S2.

True about receptor potential is?,,"ANSWER: (D) Is a graded changeREF: Textbook of Medical Physiology by Khurana page 1032-1033, Physiology - Prep Manual for Undergraduates, 4th Edition by Vijaya D Joshi page 562, Ganongs 22nd ed p. 123-125When a stimulus excites the receptor, it changes the potential across the membrane of the receptors. This change in the potential is called receptor or generator potential.The change in membrane potential in a receptor is caused by a change in permeability of membrane of the unmylelinated terminals to Na+. The resultant influx of Na+ causes development of generator or receptor potential. Since the receptor potential may generate the action potential it is also called as generator potential.The larger the receptor potential, the greater the frequency of action potential generated in the afferent neuron. A larger receptor potential can not bring about a larger action potential (because of all or none phenomenon), but it can induce more rapid firing of action potential.DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RECEPTOR POTENTIAL AND ACTION POTENTIAL:Receptor potentialAction potentialReceptor potential is a graded response i.e. amplitude of receptor potential increases with increase velocity of stimulus application and increase strength of stimulusAction potential obeys all or none law i.e. further increase in stimulus above threshold do not bring any change in amplitudeCan be added together if second stimulus arrives before the first stimulus is overCan not be added togetherHas no refractory periodHas a refractory period of 1 msMostly it is local and can not be propagatedIt can be propagated without loss in the amplitude along the nerve fibreDuration is greater (approximately 5-10 ms)Duration is small (approximately 1-2 ms)",general_faq

"In the beginning of resuscitation effos, 0.5 mg of epinephrine is administered subcutaneously. Which adrenergic receptors, in which tissues, are responsible for the beneficial effect of epinephrine in this patient?",,"Epinephrine is a non selective adrenergic agonist and a valuable resuscitative drug because of its effects at multiple adrenergic receptor subtypes. In the treatment of anaphylaxis, epinephrine increases myocardial contractility, accelerates hea rate, causes constriction of vascular smooth muscle, and causes relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle. The principal pharmacologic effects of epinephrine that are beneficial in anaphylaxis are mediated : alpha-1 receptors in vascular smooth muscle, resulting in vasoconstriction, beta-1 receptors in the hea, resulting in increased contractility, and beta-2 receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, resulting in relaxation and relief of bronchoconstriction. (One simple mnemonic for the respective locations of beta1 and beta2 receptors is ""one hea, two lungs."") Beta-2 receptors are also found, however, in vascular smooth muscle (especially in skeletal muscle beds), were, just as in bronchial smooth muscle, they promote relaxation. (Epinephrine dilates skeletal muscle vascular beds to maximize oxygen delivery for the ""fight-or-flight"" response.) The resulting vasodilation in skeletal muscle vascular beds would, by itself, tend to decrease blood pressure, which might tend to worsen the effects of anaphylactic shock, but this effect is mitigated by the intense alpha-1 receptor stimulation, causing vasoconstriction in multiple beds. The principal action of alpha-2 receptors is at the presynaptic nerve terminal, where receptor stimulation reduces the release of norepinephrine from the nerve terminal. Epinephrine does stimulate these receptors, but it does not really contribute to the beneficial actions of epinephrine in resuscitation. Alpha-2 receptors are not located in the hea (except at presynaptic nerve terminals), alpha-2 receptors do not have a significant beneficial effect in resuscitation, and beta-1 receptors are not located in bronchial smooth muscle, but are located in the hea. Beta-1 receptors are located in the hea, not in bronchial smooth muscle. The adrenergic receptor that produces bronchial smooth muscle relaxation is beta-2. Alpha-2 receptors are located primarily at presynaptic nerve terminals, and because the beta-2 receptors in vascular smooth muscle cause vasodilation, this not a helpful effect of epinephrine in this case. Also Know: Epinephrine is indicated for the treatment of anaphylactic reactions and acute asthma exacerbations. It is considered a first-line agent in the treatment of cardiac arrest (i.e., pulseless ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation, asystole, and pulseless electrical activity). Epinephrine also causes bronchodilation and antagonizes the effects of histamine. Epinephrine significantly increases myocardial oxygen consumption and thus can exacerbate ventricular irritability in the setting of myocardial ischemia. Extravasation causes necrosis and sloughing, and requires prompt infiltration of the affected area with phentolamine. Ref: Miller B.A., Clements E.A. (2011). Chapter 24.

Fibrosis, Pregnancy) Anaesthesia FRC does not change with age> Emphysema is a condition of the lung characterized by abnormal permanent enlargement of the airspaces distal to the terminal bronchiole, accompanied by destruction of their walls and without obvious fibrosis.> Principal antielastase activity in serum and interstitial tissue is alpha 1 -AT (others are secretory leukoprotease inhibitor in bronchial mucus and serum alphal -macroglobulin), and the principal cellular elastase activity is derived from neutrophils (other elastases are formed by macrophages, mast cells, pancreas, and bacteria). Neutrophil elastase is capable of digesting human lung, and this digestion can be inhibited by alphal-antitrypsin.> The most plausible hypothesis to account for the destruction of alveolar walls is the protease-antiprotease mechanism. This hypothesis is based on two important observations, one clinical and one experimental. The first is that homozygous patients with a genetic deficiency of the protease inhibitor alphal -AT have a markedly enhanced tendency to develop pulmonary emphysema, which is compounded by smoking.# Emphysema is classified into distinct pathologic types:> The most important types being centriacinar and panacinar.# Centriacinar emphysema, the type most frequently associated with cigarette smoking, is characterized by enlarged airspaces found (initially) in association with respiratory bronchioles.> Centriacinar emphysema is most prominent in the upper lobes and superior segments of lower lobes and is often quite focal.# Panacinar emphysema refers to abnormally large airspaces evenly distributed within and across acinar units.> Panacinar emphysema is usually observed in patients with a1 AT deficiency.> Pulmonary function testing shows airflow obstruction with a reduction in FEV1 and FEV1/FVC With worsening disease severity, lung volumes may increase, resulting in an increase in total lung capacity, functional residual capacity, and residual volume.> In patients with emphysema, the diffusing capacity may be reduced, reflecting the parenchymal destruction characteristic of the disease.",general_faq

Who coined term anaesthesia,,"Oliver Wendell Holmes coined the term anesthesia. In 1846, Holmes coined the word anesthesia. In a letter to dentist William T. G. Moon, the first practitioner to publicly demonstrate the use of ether during surgery, he wrote: ""Everybody wants to have a hand in a great discovery. All I will do is to give a hint or two as to names--or the name--to be applied to the state produced and the agent. The state should, I think, be called ""Anaesthesia."" This signifies insensibility--more paicularly ... to objects of touch."" Ether was used for frivolous purposes (""ether frolics""), but not as an anesthetic agent in humans until 1842, when Crawford W. Long and William E. Clark independently used it on patients for surgery and dental extraction, respectively. However, neither Long nor Clark publicized his discovery. Four years later, in Boston, on October 16, 1846, William T.G. Moon conducted the first publicized demonstration of general anesthesia for surgical operation using ether. The dramatic success of that exhibition led the operating surgeon to exclaim to a skeptical audience: ""Gentlemen, this is no humbug!"" Joseph Priestley produced nitrous oxide in 1772, and Humphry Davy first noted its analgesic propeies in 1800.

Bound by a single trilaminar cell membrane that contains a sterol. Extremely pleomorphic varying in shape from coccoid to filamentous to other bizzare forms. Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, Spiroplasma and Anaeroplasma cannot synthesize their own cholesterol and require it as a growth factor in culture medium. Acholeplasma synthesizes carotenol as a substitute for cholesterol, but will incorporate cholesterol if it is provided. Insensitive to cell-wall active antibiotics such as penicillins and cephalosporins. Limited biosynthetic capabilities due to a small genome. Multiply by binary fission. However, cytoplasmic division may lag behind genome division. This results in the formation of multinucleate filaments and other shapes. Do not possess flagellae or pili, but some mycoplasmas including M. pneumoniae, exhibit gliding motility on liquid-covered surfaces. This is attributed to specialized tip structures that also help the organisms in the attachment to the cell. Non sporing Stain poorly with Grams stain. Can be stained with Giemsa and Dienes methods. Are considered as stable L forms by some researchers but this hypothesis is still not fully accepted. Aerobes and facultative anaerobes except Anaeroplasma which is strictly anaerobic. For primary isolation, an atmosphere of 95% Nitrogen and 5% Carbon dioxide is preferred. They can grow within a temperature range of 22-41degC, the parasitic species growing optimally at 35-37degC. For fermentative organisms, the initial pH of the medium is adjusted to 7.3-7.8, for arginine metabolizing organisms it should be around 7 and for ureaplasmas, range of pH should be 6-6.5. PPLO broth/agar and SP4 media are used for isolation of mycoplasmas. Fried egg colony morphology is obtained on culture media. Ref : Textbook of Microbiology by Dr. D.R.

Most normal human traits are inherited neither as dominant nor as recessive mendelian attributes, but rather in a more complex manner. For example, multifactorial inheritance determines intelligence, height, skin color, body habitus, and even emotional disposition. Similarly, most of the common chronic disorders of adults represent multifactorial genetic diseases and are well known to ""run in families."" Such maladies include diabetes, atherosclerosis, and many forms of cancer and arthritis, and hypertension. The inheritance of a number of birth defects is also multifactorial (e.g., cleft lip and palate, pyloric stenosis, hypospadias, and congenital heart disease). The concept of multifactorial inheritance is based on the notion that multiple genes interact with various environmental factors to produce disease in an individual patient. Such inheritance leads to familial aggregation that does not obey simple mendelian rules (see choices A, B, D, and E). As a consequence, the inheritance of polygenic diseases is studied by the methods of population genetics, rather than by the analysis of individual family pedigrees.Diagnosis: Hypospadias, multifactorial inheritance",general_faq

First sign of intrauterine pregnancy is presence of yolk sac within the gestational sac.deg Extra Edge The position of a normal gestational sac is in the mid to upper uterus. As the sac implants into the decidualized endometrium it is adjacent to the linear central cavity echo complex without displacing this echogenic anatomic landmark. This is known as Intradecidual Sign. As the sac enlarges it gradually impresses on and deforms the central cavity echo complex giving rise to the characteristic sonographic appearance of the double decidual sac signdeg This sign is most effective with transabdominal sonography, performed at 5 - 6 weeks gestational age because using this approach, sonographer can confirm the presence of an intrauterine pregnancy before a yolk sac is identified.",general_faq

Bar diagramLength of the bars, drawn vertical or horizontal, indicates the frequency of a character. Bar may be drawn in ascending or descending order of magnitude. Spacing between any two bars should be nearly equal to half of the width of the bar. There are four types of bar diagrams,a) Simple bar diagram:Here bars can be arranged vertically or horizontally. A suitable scale must be used to present the length of the bars.b) Multiple bar diagram:Here two or more bars are grouped together.c) Component bar diagram:The bars may be divided into two or more parts. Each part represents a certain item.d) Proportional bar diagram:Each bar represents 100%. The bars may be divided into two or more parts. Each part is proportional to the magnitude of that particular itemHeight, weight, blood pressure1. Histogram - To construct a histogram the class intervals are plotted along X axis (horizontal line) and corresponding frequencies (or no. of observations) on Y-axis (vertical line). Rectangles are constructed such that height of a rectangle is proportional to the frequency of class and width is equal to length of the class. If all classes are of equal length then all the rectangles will have equal width. Histogram is an area diagram.2. Pie diagramThe frequencies of the groups are shown in a circle. Degrees of angle denote the frequency and area of the sector. Size of each angle is calculated by the formula as: Angle (Degrees) = Class frequency X 360deg/Total observations2. Frequency polygon - It is an area diagram of frequency distribution developed over a histogram. Join the midpoints of class intervals at the height of frequencies by straight lines. It gives a polygon, i.e., figure with many angles.3. Pictogram -- It is a popular method of presenting data to the layman. Here each picture indicates a unit of characteristic. These charts can be used for illiterate persons. Because of its attractive presentation it can be utilized for the man on the street.3. Frequency curve - when the no. of observations is very large and group intervals are reduced, the frequency polygon tends to lose angulations giving place to a smooth curve known as frequency curve.4. Spot map - These maps are prepared to show geographical distribution of frequencies of characteristic4. Line chart - This is a frequency polygon presenting variations by line. It shows the trend of an event occurring over a period of time-rising, falling or showing fluctuations. Cumulative frequency curve (Ogive) - Successive class frequencies are added and a frequency polygon is drawn. Number or percent of observations falling below or above a specific value can be presented in this graph. Any point below which there are certain percent of observations is called as percentile and graph drawn out of such points is a 'percentile graph'.5. Scatter (Correlation) diagram: It is graphic representation made to show the nature of correlation between two variable characters X and Y in the same person(s) or group(s) such as height and weight in men aged 20 years, hence it is also called correlation diagram. The characters are read on the base (X-axis) and vertical (Y-axis) and the perpendiculars drawn from these readings meet to give one scatter point. Varying frequencies of the characters give a number of such points or dots that show a scatter. A line is drawn to show the nature of correlation at a glance.",general_faq

Which of the following complications is currently the major limitation to the long-term success of cardiac transplantation?,,"Currently, graft aeriosclerosis (AKA graft vascular disease) is the most impoant limit to the long-term success of hea transplantation. For unknown reasons, the coronary aeries of transplanted heas undergo intimal thickening associated with hyperplasia of myocytes and fibroblasts and deposition of matrix. This results in luminal stenosis and myocardial ischemia. Patients may develop myocardial infarction, which is clinically silent because the hea is denervated. The overall survival after hea transplantation is 80% at 1 year and 60% at 5 years. Do not confuse graft aeriosclerosis with graft atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is caused by accumulation of cholesterol esters and development of atheromas. Atherosclerosis may recur in the coronary aeries of transplanted heas, but is not a limiting factor in long-term success of hea transplantation. Allograft rejection is ceainly a major postoperative problem. However, thanks to early diagnosis based on periodic endomyocardial biopsy and the availability of immunosuppressant therapy, this complication can be prevented or successfully treated. Although oppounistic infections and development of Epstein-Barr related lymphomas are undesired effects of profound immunosuppression, these complications do not constitute a significant limitation to the overall outcome of cardiac transplantation.

Principal larger vessels affected are the abdominal aoa, descending thoracic aoa, internal carotid aeries and medium to smaller sized vessels affected are popliteal aeries, coronary aeries, and circle of Willis in brain. The atheroma may be preceded by fatty streaks that are intimal collection of lipid-laden macrophages and smooth muscle cells, occurring in persons as young as one year of age.The disease typically manifests in later life as the vessel lumen is compromised, predisposing to thrombosis and the underlying media is thinned, predisposing to aneurysm formation. It is the number one killer disease, 50 per cent of all deaths in the USA are attributed to atherosclerosis and half of theseare due to acute myocardial infarctions. The remainder include cerebrovascular accidents (""stroke""), aneurysm rupture, mesenteric occlusion and gangrene of theextremities. Etiological Factors Major risk factors in CHD have been discussed earlier. Risk of developing atherosclerosis increases with age, a positive family history, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypeension, and hypercholesterolemia. The risk is correlated with elevated LDL and inversely related to the HDL level. Hereditary defects, e.g. familial hypercholesterolemia involving the LDL receptor or the LDL apoproteins cause elevated LDL, hypercholesterolemia andaccelerated atherosclerosis.

"Hemoglobin is isolated from the erythrocytes of a young child with anemia. Hemoglobin electrophoresis reveals the presence of an unstable hemoglobin, known as hemoglobin Cranston (HbCr), containing an abnormal b-globin chain.

HbNl: AAGUAUCACUAAGCUCGC HbCr: AAGAGUAUCACUAAGCUCGCUUUC >>> UAU UAA Which of the following would account for the development of HbCr?",,"Looking at the coding segment of the normal b-gene of hemoglobin, one should read the information codon by codon, as follows: AAG UAU CAC UAA GCU CGC 1 2 3 4 5 6 The normal b-globin gene has a stop codon (UAA) at the 4th position, therefore the last 2 codons (GCU and CGC) are not translated and do not code for amino acid residues found in the protein. Comparing this information to the coding segment of the mutated b-gene of hemoglobin Cranston, one would notice the following: AAG AGU AUC ACU AAG CUC GCU UUC UAU UAA 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 etc etc The inseion of two base pairs (AG) results in a frameshift mutation that eliminates the stop codon at position 4, thereby causing the addition of amino acids normally not translated in the hemoglobin b-chain of the child. Since the chain is now too long, this destabilizes the tetrameric conformation of hemoglobin. A frameshift mutation resulting in deletion of several amino acids is wrong, since such a mutation would have inseed a stop codon (UAA, UGA or UAG) before position 4. A mutation in the stop codon would have resulted in a longer-than-normal b-globin gene, but the information given does not indicate any changes in the stop codon at position 4. Interestingly, a chain elongation by mutation in the stop codon exists and is known as hemoglobin Constant Spring, affecting the a-chain of hemoglobin. A point mutation is the result of a single base pair change, which is not the case here. A point mutation resulting in the inseion of a new stop codon is called a nonsense mutation, and it would result in a shoer-than-normal protein. Ref: Weil P. (2011). Chapter 37.

A 6 year old girl is easily distracted in class and exhibits poor scholastic performance. Seizures are precipitated by hyperventilation. What is the probable diagnosis?,,"Typical absence seizures are characterized by sudden, brief lapses of consciousness without loss of postural control. The seizure typically lasts for only seconds, consciousness returns as suddenly as it was lost, and there is no postictal confusion. Although the brief loss of consciousness may be clinically inapparent or the sole manifestation of the seizure discharge, absence seizures are usually accompanied by subtle, bilateral motor signs such as rapid blinking of the eyelids, chewing movements, or small-amplitude, clonic movements of the hands. Typical absence seizures are associated with a group of genetically determined epilepsies with onset usually in childhood (ages 4-8 years) or early adolescence and are the main seizure type in 15-20% of children with epilepsy. Since the clinical signs of the seizures are subtle, especially to parents who may not have had previous experience with seizures, it is not surprising that the first clue to absence epilepsy is often unexplained ""daydreaming"" and a decline in school performance recognized by a teacher. Hyperventilation tends to provoke these electrographic discharges and even the seizures themselves and is routinely used when recording the EEG. Ref: Lowenstein D.H. (2012). Chapter 369.

Definition: The mechanical form located in the upper posterior region of an articulator that controls movement of its mobile member (GPT8).
Condylar guide inclination: The angle formed by the inclination of a condylar guide control surface of an articulator and a specified reference plane (GPT8).

This is the mandibular guidance generated by the condyles traversing the contours of the glenoid fossa.
It is duplicated in the articulator. The extent of duplication depends on the articulator’s capability, whether it is semi-adjustable or fully adjustable.
Protrusive condylar guidance is obtained using protrusive records,while the lateral condylar guidance is obtained using Hanau’s formula or lateral records 
It is designated as an inclination or angle – condylar guidance angle or inclination – and is expressed in degrees.
This is the only factor that is obtained from the patient and is not under the dentist’s control.
A shallow condylar guidance will cause less posterior tooth separation in protrusion and requires teeth with shorter cusps and flatter fossa to achieve balanced occlusion, than a steep guidance.

Peripheral resistance is best indicated by:,,"Ans. a. Diastolic blood pressure Aerial hypeension is the result of abnormal flow/resistance relationships. Resistance to outflow consists of different components: the systolic component is the one generated by conductance vessels, whereas the diastolic component consists of peripheral resistance, which regulates peripheral blood supply due to the run-off of conductance vessels during left ventricular diastole. Thus, an increase in systemic resistance results in a rise in diastolic blood pressure. If the elasticity of conductance vessels decreases, diastolic run-off also decreases and diastolic blood pressure goes down. When this loss of elasticity occurs, the ejection force cannot be anymore offset by aerial distension, the pulse wave velocity increases and reflex waves to the hea arrive earlier, causing the systolic blood pressure to augment. Such an augmentation, together with decreasing diastolic blood pressure results in an enhancement of the pulse pressure. When the stroke volume is normal, an increase in pulse pressure is, therefore, a marker of altered conductance. However, if, due to loss of elasticity of the conductance aeries diastolic blood pressure goes down, increasing systolic pressure also protects against a decrease in mean pressure. Indeed, in conditions of elevated pulse pressure, the mean pressure can be normal or high, indicating that when evaluating blood pressure all components should be taken into consideration. A high systolic blood pressure associated with a normal mean blood pressure is suggestive of a normal peripheral resistance.'Diastolic PressureSystolic pressure is peak pressure reached during systole, similarly, diastolic pressure refers to lowest pressure during diastole.Diastolic blood pressure is an index to peripheral resistance.Elasticity of aoa and large aeries is mainly responsible for origin and maintenance of diastolic pressure (by Windkessel elastic recoil effect).Because the elasticity is higher in younger subjects, diastolic pressure is maintained and pulse pressure is narrow.Because the elasticity is lower in old persons, diastolic pressure is decreased and pulse pressure is widened.",general_faq

All of the following statements about the control of micturition are true except:,,"Micturition is initiated by activation of afferent sensory fibers located in the wall of the bladder; these fibers sense the degree of stretch of the bladder wall. In addition, these sensory fibers travel back to the spinal cord via sacral dorsal roots. The sensory information that reaches the spinal cord also travels to the micturition center in the rostral pons. When sensory activity to the micturition center is sufficient, a command is sent to the sacral spinal cord, leading to activation of parasympathetic fibers. The parasympathetic fibers travel to the bladder via the pelvic nerve. Activation of these fibers leads to bladder contraction. Destruction of the sacral dorsal roots (as occurs with tabes dorsalis) abolishes the reflex because sensory afferent fibers no longer send signals back to the spinal cord.
A spinal cord injury at L1 is well above the sacral region where the micturition reflex originates. How ever, the central nervous system (CNS) plays an important role in facilitating or inhibiting the micturition reflex, and this function is lost with spinal cord injury. Although some patients with spinal cord injury can still elicit a micturition response (e.g., stroking of the skin in the genital region), the bladder in these patients has increased muscle tone and fails to empty completely. As the bladder becomes more and more distended, an involuntary micturition reflex can occur. However, the CNS can keep urine from being voided under these circumstances by maintaining a constant tonic contraction of the external sphincter. This contraction is accomplished through continued activation of so matic nerves that travel in the pudendal nerve from the sacral spinal cord to the external sphincter. The point at which an urge to void first occurs corresponds to a bladder volume of approximately 150 ml. However, bladder volume can increase more than twofold before involuntary micturition occurs. At 400 ml a marked sense of fullness is present. Parasympathetic fibers originating in the sacral spinal cord innervate the body of the bladder, and it is activation of these fibers that leads to bladder contraction.",general_faq
Drug of choice for a case of uncomplicated cystitis -,,"Ans. is 'd' i.e.. Fosfomycin[Ref: OBJECTIVE: To determine the drug of choice for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis. METHOD: Drug selection was performed by means of the so-called 'system of objectified judgment analysis' (SOJA) method by a working group of 11 persons. The following selection criteria were used: pharmacokinetics, interactions, the probability of hitting (the probability that the microorganism is sensitive to the antibiotic), development of resistance, specific use in urinary tract infections, efficacy, side effects, dosage-frequency, duration of treatment, cost and documentation. The following drugs were included in the study: amoxicillin (with or without clavulanic acid), nitrofurantoin, sulfamethizole, trimethoprim, co-trimoxazole, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and fosfomycin trometamol. RESULTS: Fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin slow release showed the highest scores. The main selection criteria that determined the selection of a drug were especially specific use in urinary tract infections, development of resistance, the probability of hitting and cost. CONCLUSION: Fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin slow release best fulfill the requirements for drugs in the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis. No comparative studies have been performed with the 3-day treatment of uncomplicated cystitis with nitrofurantoin slow release or with trimethoprim. Fluoroquinolones play no important part in the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis, mainly because of the risk of development of resistance.",medicine_info

Most commonly used measure of central tendency-,,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Mean * The commonly used statistical average (measures of central tendency) are (i) Arithmetic mean, (ii) Median and (iii) Mode.Arithmetic mean* It is the most commonly used statistical average. It is obtained by sum of all the values divided by total number of values.Mean =[?]x----e* The major disadvantage of mean is that it may be unduly influenced by abnormal high or low values in the distribution.Median* It is the middle most value in a distribution arranged in ascending or descending order. If there are two values in the middle, instead of one, the median is worked out by taking the average of two middle values.* The main advantage of median is that it is not affected by abnormal high or low values (unlike mean). Therefore, median is used in skewed distribution (distribution which is skewed/deviated due to small number of very high or low values).Mode* It is the most frequently occuring value in a distribution. If there are two most frequent values, there are two modes and the distribution is called 'bimodal distribution In bimodal distribution the mode is the average of two modes.* For bimodal distributionMode = (3 x median) - (2 x mean)* Mode is the central tendency which is least affected by extreme values or skewness (But median is the preferred central tendency in skewed distribution).",general_faq

Allergic rhinitis is which type of hypersensitivity-,,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Type -1 Pathogenesis of allergic rhinitiso Allergic rhinitis is a type I hypersensitivityIt occurs in two phases:-1) Initial response/Acute or early phase# After first antigen exposure, this antigen is presented to CD-4 helper T cells (TH, type) by antigen presenting cells. These primed TH, cells release IL-4 that acts on B-cells to form Ig E specific for that particular antigen. The antigen specific Ig E antibodies then bind to the surface receptors of mast cells and basophils. The process from first antigen exposure to the coating of mast cells by Ig E acts as sensitization (prior sensitization) and first exposure is also called priming or sensitizing exposure (dose). Subsequent exposure (shocking dose) to same antigen then results in activation of mast cells and basophils with release of inflammatory mediators : -i) Histamine (most important)ii) Hepariniii) Leukotriens (B4, C4> D4)iv) PGD2v) PAFvi) Cytokines (IL-1, 3, 4, 5, 6; INF)vii) Eosinophil chemolactic factor (ECF)viii) Neutrophil chemolactic factor (NCF)The release of these mediators result in : -Increased vascular permeability and vasodilatation which result in tissue edema - Nasal blockage and sneezing.Smooth muscle spasm - BronchoconstrictionHyperactivity of glands - RhinorrheaRecruitment of inflammatory cells.2) Late phase responseRecruited inflammatory cells of initial phase amplify and sustain the inflammatory response without additional exposure to the triggered antigen. PAF is the most important mediator in initiation of late phase response. Eosinophils are particularly important cells among the recruited cells which also include neutrophils, basophils, monocytes and T-cells.

What is the most likely cause of his symptoms?",,"Hyponatremia in association with a lung mass usually indicates small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) production by the tumor. About 10% of lung cancers present with a paraneoplastic syndrome. Tumors producing ADH or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) are overwhelmingly SCLCs, which arise from hormonally active neuroendocrine cells. SCLC is a rapidly growing neoplasm; early mediastinal involvement, as in this case, is common. Tumor staging for SCLC differs from non-small cell cancers. SCLCs are simply classified as limited (confined to one hemithorax) or extensive. Limited tumors are usually managed with combination radiation and chemotherapy, with approximately 20% cure rate. Extensive tumors are treated with palliative chemotherapy alone; durable remissions are rare. Surgery is not curative in SCLC.Bronchial carcinoids are usually benign. Although they can produce ACTH, mediastinal involvement and hyponatremia would not be expected. Adenocarcinoma of the lung, although common, rarely causes a paraneoplastic syndrome. Localized benign lung infections (especially lung abscess) can cause syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) but would not account for this patient's mediastinal adenopathy.

Coagulative necrosis is seen in:,,"Coagulative necrosis is a form of necrosis in which the underlying tissue architecture is preserved for at least several days after the death of cells in the tissue. The affected tissues take on a firm texture. Presumably, the injury denatures not only structural proteins but also enzymes, thereby blocking the proteolysis of the dead cells; as a result, eosinophilic, anucleate cells may persist for days or weeks. Leukocytes are recruited to the site of necrosis, and the dead cells are ultimately digested by the action of lysosomal enzymes of the leukocytes. The cellular debris is then removed by phagocytosis, mediated primarily by infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages. Coagulative necrosis is characteristic of infarcts (areas of necrosis caused by ischemia) in all solid organs except the brain.

This patient is at risk for which of the following conditions?",,"This woman likely suffers from reflux esophagitis, a condition in which the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) does not adequately prevent acidic gastric contents from refluxing back into the distal esophagus. Most commonly, there is a defect in the LES mechanism itself, in addition to secondary causes such as pregnancy (due to increased abdominal pressure) and some medications (anticholinergics, beta-2 agonists, theophylline, nitrates, calcium-channel blockers). Symptoms can mimic cardiac chest pain and must be carefully evaluated. Complications of reflux esophagitis include esophageal strictures, ulcerations, laryngitis, pulmonary aspiration, and Barrett's esophagus (columnar metaplasia of the distal esophagus). Barrett's esophagus is considered a premalignant state, with roughly a 30-fold increase in the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma. The normal squamous epithelium of the esophagus transforms into columnar epithelium similar to gastric epithelium as a result of recurrent reflux of acidic gastric contents. Anginal pain, signaling cardiac ischemia, is generally not burning in nature, and is not relieved by antacids. Mallory-Weiss lesions are actual tears of the epithelia of the proximal stomach or distal esophagus as a result of retching (seen in anorexics and alcoholics).

Which of the following cardiac complications may develop in a 33 year old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) because of her underlying condition?,,"Libman-Sacks endocarditis affects patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Small granular vegetations consisting of fibrin develop on the undersurface of the leaflets of mitral and aoic valves. Fragments of vegetations may detach, resulting in embolism. Eventually, vegetations heal by organization of fibrin and subsequent fibrosis, leading to distoion of valve leaflets and resultant insufficiency or stenosis. The pathogenesis is unclear but is probably related to thrombotic diathesis. Hemorrhagic pericarditis is usually a consequence of tuberculosis or metastatic spread of cancer to the pericardium. An exudate containing blood accumulates in the pericardial sac, producing pain and a characteristic auscultatory phenomenon known as a pericardial rub. SLE is associated instead with fibrinous pericarditis, which also manifests with chest pain and pericardial rub. Infective endocarditis is prevalent in patients with damaged or prosthetic valves and in intravenous drug abusers. It is associated with formation of bulky, friable vegetations that consist of masses of fibrin, neutrophils, and bacteria. Such vegetations cause extensive destruction of valve leaflets and may release fragments into the bloodstream, with resultant septic embolism. There is no association between SLE and mitral valve prolapse, which is a frequent, usually asymptomatic, valvular abnormality that occurs in 2% to 3% of the general population. Mitral valve prolapse is also associated with Marfan syndrome. Complications include sudden death, thromboembolism, and mitral regurgitation. Ref: Kaul M.S., Tapson V.F., St. Clair E. (2011).

This is also known as Cushing's disease and is responsible for 65% of endogenous Cushing's syndrome. In adrenal Cushing's, excess coisol is produced by adrenal gland tumors, hyperplastic adrenal glands, or adrenal glands with nodular adrenal hyperplasia.

The systolic murmur is classified into : ? a) Ejection systolic murmur b) Pansystolic murmur Pansystolic murmur is always abnormal no matter what is its intesity. Only three lesions produce pansystolic murmur --> i)VSD ii) MR iii) TR Ejection systolic murmur on the other hand may be organic or functional. If ejection systolic murmur is associated with thrill, it is always organic. If ejection systolic murmur is more than grade III intensity --) It is organic. Grade III or less ejection systolic murmur of a functional type may be heard in anemia or high fever in otherwise normal children. 2) Diastolic murmur Presence of diastolic murmur always indicates the presence of organic hea disease. There are two exceptions. i) Severe hypeension --> Reduction of BP may cause an AR murmur to disappear. ii) Anemia --> May result in delayed diastolic murmur across the tricuspid and mitral area. 3) Cyanosis Central cyanosis indicates presence of hea disease if lung disease has been excluded. 4) CHF Presence of CHF indicates presence of hea disease except in neonates and infants who get CHF from causes such as hypoglycemia and anemia. B) Minor criteria 1) Systolic murmur less than grade III in intensity. 2) Abnormal second hea sound Abnormal S2 always indicates presence of hea disease. It has been included as a minor criterian only because auscultation is an individual and subjective finding. 3) Abnormal ECG Main value of ECG lies in determining the : ? i) Mean QRS axis ii) Right or left atrial hyperophy iii) Right or left ventricular hyperophy 4) Abnormal X-ray If there is cardiomegaly in a good inspiratory film, it is highly suggestive for the presence of hea disease. 5) Abnormal BP",general_faq

Skin pathergy test Site: A hairless area on the flexor aspect of the forearm sterile needle (20 gauge) prick or an intradermal injection of normal saline, monosodium urate (MSU) crystals or streptococcal antigens to perform the test. The procedure is performed on a hairless pa of the volar forearm. Generally, the needle is inseed veically or diagonally at an angle of 45deg to a depth of 3-5 mm. The needle should reach the dermis for a proper response. Clinical evaluation: Readings are taken after 48 hrs of the needle prick. A 1-2mm papule that is usually felt by palpation and which is surrounded by an erythematous halo is formed on the skin. The papule may remain as a papule or transform into a 1-5mm pustule.

Germline mosaicism o Germline mosacism results from a mutation that occurs postzygotically during early embryonic development. In these a poion of the egg or sperm cells of a parent carries the mutation. o Because the mutation affects only cells destined to form the gonads the gametes carry the mutation but somatic cells of the individual are completely normal. o A phenotypically normal parent who has germ line mosaicism can transmit the disease causing mutation to the offspring through the mutant gamete. o Because the progenitor cells of the gamete carry the mutation there is a definite possibility that more than one child of such a parent would be affected. o Obviously, the likelihood of such an occurrence depends on the propoion of germ cells carrying the mutation.",general_faq

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)# SCC of the eyelid is uncommon, accounting for about 5% of all eyelid tumours.# It can occur from a precancerous condition, such as actinic keratosis or Bowen's disease.# These tumours are also related to sun exposure and are similar to squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.# SCC tends to behave more aggressively and is more likely to spread than BCC.c. Sebaceous gland carcinoma (SGC)# SGC is cancer of the glands in the eyelid.# It is a rare tumour that may account for up to 5% of all eyelid cancers.# It occurs more often in women than men and occurs most often in the elderly.# These tumours develop most often on the upper eyelid, followed by the lower eyelid and the caruncleo SGC can start in the Meibomian glands, glands of Zeis or the sebaceous glands of the caruncle.# SGC is often diagnosed at a later stage because it can mimic benign conditions. It can also grow aggressively.# SGC may be multifocal (occurring in more than one place), so they have a tendency to recur after treatmentd Malignant melanoma# Melanoma of the eyelid is very uncommon and accounts for less than 1% of all eyelid cancers.# Melanoma of the eyelid is similar to melanoma of the skin of the skin.

Most common site for lymphoma in AIDS patients is,,"Ref Robbins 9/e p254, 8/e p529,7/e p549 Pathogenesis of CNS Involvement The pathogenesis of the neurologic manifestations in AIDS deserves special mention because, in addition to the lymphoid system, the nervous system is a major target of HIV infection. Macrophages and cells belonging to the monocyte-macrophage lineage (microglial cells) are the predominant cell types in the brain that are infected with HIV. The virus is most likely carried into the brain by infected monocytes (thus, brain HIV isolates are almost exclusively of the R5 type). The mechanism of HIV-induced damage of the brain, however, remains obscure. Because neurons are not infected by HIV, and the extent of neuro- pathologic changes is often less than might be expected from the severity of neurologic symptoms, most expes believe that the neurologic deficit is caused indirectly by viral products and soluble factors (e.g., cytokines such as TNF) produced by macrophages and microglial cells. In addition, injury from nitric oxide induced in neuronal cells by gp41 and direct damage of neurons by soluble HIV gp120 have been postulated.",general_faq
All of the following statements about the control of micturition are true Except,,"Micturition is initiated by activation of afferent sensory fibers located in the wall of the bladder; these fibers sense the degree of stretch of the bladder wall. In addition, these sensory fibers travel back to the spinal cord sacral dorsal roots. The sensory information that reaches the spinal cord also travels to the micturition center in the rostral pons. When sensory activity to the micturition center is sufficient, a command is sent to the sacral spinal cord, leading to activation of parasympathetic fibers. The parasympathetic fibers travel to the bladder the pelvic nerve. Activation of these fibers leads to bladder contraction. Destruction of the sacral dorsal roots (as occurs with tabes dorsalis) abolishes the reflex because sensory afferent fibers no longer send signals back to the spinal cord. A spinal cord injury at L1 is well above the sacral region where the micturition reflex originates. However, the central nervous system (CNS) plays an impoant role in facilitating or inhibiting the micturition reflex, and this function is lost with spinal cord injury. Although some patients with spinal cord injury can still elicit a micturition response (e.g., stroking of the skin in the genital region), the bladder in these patients has increased muscle tone and fails to empty completely. As the bladder becomes more and more distended, an involuntary micturition reflex can occur. However, the CNS can keep urine from being voided under these circumstances by maintaining a constant tonic contraction of the external sphincter. This contraction is accomplished through continued activation of somatic nerves that travel in the pudendal nerve from the sacral spinal cord to the external sphincter. The point at which an urge to void first occurs corresponds to a bladder volume of approximately 150 ml. However, bladder volume can increase more than twofold before involuntary micturition occurs. At 400 ml a marked sense of fullness is present. Parasympathetic fibers originating in the sacral spinal cord innervate the body of the bladder, and it is activation of these fibers that leads to bladder contraction.",general_faq

A child is posted for operative repair of exostrophy of bladder with renal failure. Which anesthetic should be preferred?,,"C i.e. Ataracurium In pediatric patients the choice of non depolarizing muscle relaxant depends on side effects and duration of action. The method of excretion of atracurium and cisatracurium (Hofman elimination and ester hydrolysis) makes these relaxants paicularly useful in newborns and children with liver or renal diseaseQ. If tachycardia is desired (eg with fentanyl anesthesia), pancuronium would be an appropriate choice. Vecuronium, atracurium, rocuronium & cisatracurium are useful for shoer procedures. Rocuronium offers an advantage that it can be administered intramuscularly (like Sch) preferably in deltoid however, the duration of action is - 1 hour, which could be a distinct disadvantage for a brief procedure. Vecuronium is valuable because no histamine is released; however, its duration of action is prolonged in newborns, which makes it similar to pancuronium The potential for rhabdomyolysis & hyperkalemia (paicularly in boys < 8 yrs who may have unrecognized muscular dystrophy), as well as for masseter spasm (jaws of steel), malignant hypehermia, cardiac arrhythmias, and myoglobinemia after administration of succinyl choline suggests that Sch should not be used routinely in children. Unlike adult patients profound bradycardia & sinus node arrest can develop in pediatric patients following 1st dose of Sch without atropine pretreatment. If a child unexpectedly experiences cardiac arrest following Sch administration, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Howeve, it is the only available ultrasho acting muscle relaxant that provides a dependable, rapid onset of action. IV use of Sch should be limited to children who have full stomach or to treat laryngospasm. Intramuscular, intralingual (Submental) use is indicated for children with difficult intravenous access when control of airway is deemed essential. Mivacurium is an alternative to Sch when profound neuromuscular block of sho duration is required but rapid onset of action is unnecessary. Antagonism of neuromuscular blockade in all neonates & small infants, is recommended, even if they have recovered clinically, because any increase in work of breathing may cause fatigue and respiratory failure. Sugammadex, a cyclodextrin whose endoskeleton forms a water soluble complex with exoskeleton of rocuronium, is designed to antagonize the effects of rocuronium. As it is made of sugars and antagonize by covalent bonding the side effects are minimal. Antagonism is more rapid than neostigmine/atropine. It also reverse the other steroidal relaxants vecuronium & pancuronium to a lesser extent. The mechanism of reversal is lowering of plasma conentation & thus reversing the concentration gradient and pulling the rocuronium off the myoneural junction.",general_faq

"Minimal change glomerulopathy may be seen ' association with all of the following except,",,"Secondary MCD wherein the extraglomerular disease process evokes, directly or indirectly, the characteristic changes in permselectivity and morphology. In this circumstance the morphology is similar, if not identical, to primary or 'idiopathic' MCD. Moreover, it is possible, even likely, that similar or identical pathogenetic mechanisms are operative. In this scenario, a distinct etiologic link is presumed to exist between the extraglomerular disease process and the occurrence of MCD. Such a linkage would be strongly suppoed if cure of the extraglomerular disease lead to the eradication of MCD and if recurrence of the extraglomerular disorder was associated with relapse. While an attempt has been made to be comprehensive, it is possible that individual repos describing an association between the specific extra-glomerular disease and MCD may have been overlooked. The majority of the instances in which MCD has been associated with an extraglomerular disease involve neoplastic processes and idiosyncratic, hyper-sensitivity or toxic reactions to drugs. Neoplasia A variety of neoplastic processes have been repoed in association with MCD (Table 2) . In some, the association is rare enough to suspect that chance alone may have been the operational mechanism underlying the association. In others, the association is clearly contemporaneous and likely causal. Among patients with glomerular disease associated with neoplasia, 40% have MCD on renal biopsy. As mentioned previously it is possible that some of the described associations between neoplasia and MCD may be the consequence of treatment of MCD (especially cytotoxic drug therapy) predisposing to the emergence of a malignancy. Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are among the most frequently repoed neoplastic processes associated with MCD . Interestingly, repos describing the concurrence of MCD and Hodgkin's disease have decreased in recent years, perhaps due to the more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies available for this and related diseases. MCD is a rare complication of Hodgkin's ppdisease occurring in from 1:2000 to 1:10 000 cases. MCD has been associated with both limited (Stage 1) and disseminated (Stage 4) forms of Hodgkin's disease.Therapy of Hodgkin's disease, either by local radio- therapy to regional lymph nodes or by systemic chemotherapy, has often resulted in remission of MCD and recurrences of Hodgkin's disease have been associated with recurrence of MCD. These observations strongly imply a causal relationship between the tumour (or a product of the abnormal neoplastic cells) and the pathophysiological abnormalities involved in MCD. Indeed, it is quite possible that the same clone of cells which are involved in the development of Hodgkin's disease are also involved in the pathogenesis of MCD in both the primary and secondary forms. Such an explanation is more difficult to conjecture for the association of MCD with theother tumours listed in Table 2, except for mycosis fungoides, angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphatic leukaemia . Perhaps, in these instances, the peurbations for MCD have also triggered the oncogenic potential of cells predisposed to neoplastic transformation (e.g. lack of a wild type tumour suppressor gene). Alternatively, lymphocytes infiltrating neoplastic growths could be induced to elaborate factors responsible for abnormal permeability. Whatever the case may be, it is wohwhile to consider potential underlying neoplasia in patients with MCD when atypical features are present such as weight loss, anorexia, lymphadenopathy, haematuria, fever, pleural effusions or skin lesions. Overall, the occurrence of MCD as a complication of neoplastic disorders is quite uncommon. MCD may precede the diagnosis of neoplasia by months or years or may follow the diagnosis of neoplasia by months or years. Some repos have suggested that NK-cell deficiency is associated with the development of MCD in patients with Hodgkin's disease Ref Harrison20th edition pg 299",general_faq

Condition that can be diagnosed on laparoscopy?,,"Ans. a (Endometriosis). (Ref.

It does not cause postmenopausal bleeding.# There may rarely be rupture or torsion of an endometrioma, irregular menses or cyclical problems with rectal bleeding, tenesmus, diarrhea, constipation, haemoptysis, dysuria, ureteric colic or scar pains.# The chance of conception may be as low as half that of the normal population (infertility).Investigations# Laproscopy is the best diagnostic measure.# Laparoscopically, endometriosis may appear white or red (active lesions), black/brown 'Powder9 burns or burn matchstick like lesions or white plaques of old collagen.# There may also be circular defects in the peritoneum (peritoneal windows/Allemmaster syndrome) or endometriomas with 'chocolate' fluid containing debris from cyclical menstruation.# Chocolate cysts of ovaries represents the most important manifestation of endometriosis.Medical treatment# Drugs are not indicated for the RX of asymptomatic, minimal endometriosis in patients wishing to conceive.# Recurrence after treatment is common.# All therapies suppress ovulation, thus conception is unlikely with good compliance.# For symptomatic endometriosis, continuous progestogen therapy, e.g., medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg TID for 90 days is most cost effective, has fewer side-effects and is more suitable for long-term use compared with more expensive alternatives. It acts by producing a state of pseudo-pregnancy, which ultimately leads to regression of the disease .# Another very cost effective alternative suitable for long term use is the continuous low-dose OCpills.# Second line drugs (alternative therapy) are the GnRH analogues, which can be administrated by nasal spray or implants (e.g., nafarelin, buseralin, goseralin, leuproelin), and the danazol 200 mg OD-TID.# Danazol is mildly anabolic, androgenic, anti-estrogenic and anti-progestational drug which acts by inhibiting pituitary gonadotropins (AIIMS-93). It causes pseudomenopause.# Its side effects are atrophy of the breasts, weight gain, hirsutism, excessive sweating, depression, & vaginitis# Conservative treatment: This may be carried out at laproscopy or laprotomy and includes diathermy destruction or laser vaporization of endometriosis deposits. Adhesions may be divided. It is also possible to enucleate or excise endometriomas.# Advantages of laser therapy in treatment of endometriosis are:- Precise tissue destruction- Minimum damage to surrounding tissues.- Relatively bloodless field- Promotes tissue healing without adhesion formation.Surgical treatment# Radical surgery (BSO +/- TAH) This may be indicated for those in whom fertility is no longer required.

This led to the concept of definitive radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy. Prior to this, the standard definitive treatment for carcinoma of the anal canal was abdominal-perineal resection, which necessitated a permanent colostomy.

Emergency contraception pills# WHO recommends levonorgestrel for emergency contraceptive pill use. Ideally, this progestogen-only method should be taken as a single dose (1.5 mg) within five days (120 hours) of unprotected intercourse. Alternatively, a woman can take the levonorgestrel in two doses (0.75 mg each; 12 hours apart).# Mode of action :Levonorgestrel emergency pills prevent pregnancy by preventing or delaying ovulation. They may also prevent fertilization of an egg by affecting the cervical mucus or the ability of sperm to bind to the egg. They are not effective once the process of implantation has begun.# Effectiveness :levonorgestrel regimen is 52-94% effective in preventing pregnancy. The regimen is more effective the sooner after intercourse it is taken.2.

An example of tumor suppressor gene is,,"Ref Robbins 7/e p300; , Harrison 17/e p499; 9/e p290 Tumor suppressor genes are the genes whose products down regulate the cell cycle. RB Gene: Governor of the Cell Cycle It is useful to begin with the retinoblastoma gene (RB), the first tumor suppressor gene to be discovered and, as it happens, a prototypical representative. As with many advances in medicine, the discovery of tumor suppressor genes was accomplished by the study of a rare disease--in this case, retinoblastoma, an uncommon childhood tumor. Approximately 60% of retinoblastomas are sporadic, and the remaining ones are familial, the predisposition to develop the tumor being transmitted as an autosomal dom- inant trait. To account for the sporadic and familial occur- rence of an identical tumor, Knudson, in 1974, proposed his now famous two-hit hypothesis, which in molecular terms can be stated as follows: * Two mutations (hits) are required to produce retinoblas- toma. These involve the RB gene, which has been mapped to chromosomal locus 13q14. Both of the normal alleles of the RB locus must be inactivated (hence the two hits) for the development of retinoblastoma (Fig. 5-21). * In familial cases, children inherit one defective copy of the RB gene in the germ line; the other copy is normal. brakes to cellular proliferation Rb gene is a tumor suppressor gene whereas My ,fos and Ra's are all example of proto oncogene Retinoblastoma develops when the normal RB gene is lost in retinoblasts as a result of somatic mutation. Because in retinoblastoma families only a single somatic mutation is required for expression of the disease, the familial transmission follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. * In sporadic cases, both normal RB alleles are lost by somatic mutation in one of the retinoblasts. The end result is the same: a retinal cell that has lost both of the normal copies of the RB gene becomes cancerous. Although the loss of normal RB genes initially was discovered in retinoblastomas, it is now evident that homo- zygous loss of this gene is a fairly common feature of several tumors, including breast cancer, small cell cancer of the lung, and bladder cancer. Patients with familial retinoblastoma also are at greatly increased risk for development of osteosarcomas and some soft tissue sarcoma The RB gene product is a DNA-binding protein that is expressed in every cell type examined, where it exists in an active hypophosphorylated state and an inactive hyperphosphor- ylated state. The impoance of Rb lies in its regulation of the G1/S checkpoint, the poal through which cells must pass before DNA replication commences. As background for an understanding of how tumor sup- pressors function, it is useful to briefly revisit the cell cycle: In embryos, cell divisions proceed at an amazing clip, with DNA replication beginning immediately after mitosis ends. As development proceeds, however, two gaps are incorpo- rated into the cell cycle: gap 1 (G1) between mitosis (M) and DNA replication (S), and gap 2 (G2) between DNA replica- tion (S) and mitosis (M) (Fig. 5-20). Although each phase of the cell cycle circuitry is monitored carefully, the transi- tion from G1 to S is believed to be an extremely impoant checkpoint in the cell cycle ""clock."" Once cells cross the G1 checkpoint they can pause the cell cycle for a time, but they are obligated to complete mitosis. In G1, however, cells can remove themselves entirely from the cell cycle, either tem- porarily (quiescence, or G0) or permanently (senescence). Indeed, during development, as cells become terminally differentiated, they exit the cell cycle and enter G0. Cells in G0 remain there until external cues, such as mitogenic sig- naling, push them back into the cell cycle. In G1, therefore, diverse signals are integrated to determine whether the cell should progress through the cell cycle, or exit the cell cycle and differentiate, and Rb is a key hub integrating external mitogenic and differentiation signals to make this decision. To appreciate this crucial role of Rb in the cell cycle, it is helpful to review the mechanisms that enforce the G1/S transition. * The initiation of DNA replication (S phase) requires the activity of cyclin E/CDK2 complexes, and expression of cyclin E is dependent on the E2F family of transcription factors. Early in G1, Rb is in its hypophosphorylated active form, and it binds to and inhibits the E2F family of transcription factors, preventing transcription of cyclin E. Hypophosphorylated Rb blocks E2F-mediated transcription in at least two ways (Fig. 5-22). First, it sequesters E2F, preventing it from interacting with other transcriptional activators. Second, Rb recruits chromatin remodeling proteins, such as histone deacetylases and histone methyltransferases, which bind to the promoters of E2F-responsive genes such as cyclin E. These enzymes modify chromatin at the promoters to make DNA insen- sitive to transcription factors. This situation is changed on mitogenic signaling. Growth factor signaling leads to cyclin D expression and activa- tion of cyclin D-CDK4/6 complexes. These complexes phosphorylate Rb, inactivating the protein and releasing E2F to induce target genes such as cyclin E. Expression of cyclin E then stimulates DNA replication and pro- gression through the cell cycle. When the cells enter S phase, they are committed to divide without additional growth factor stimulation. During the ensuing M phase, the phosphate groups are removed from Rb by cellular phosphatases, regenerating the hypophosphorylated form of Rb. * E2F is not the sole target of Rb. The versatile Rb protein binds to a variety of other transcription factors that regulate cell differentiation. For example, Rb stimulates myocyte-, adipocyte-, melanocyte-, and macrophage- specific transcription factors. Thus, the Rb pathway couples control of cell cycle progression at G0-G1 with differentiation, which may explain how differentiation is associated with exit from the cell cycle. In view of the centrality of Rb to the control of the cell cycle, an interesting question is why RB is not mutated in every cancer. In fact, mutations in other genes that control Rb phosphorylation can mimic the effect of RB loss; such genes are mutated in many cancers that seem to have normal RB genes. For example, mutational activation of CDK4 or overexpression of cyclin D ors cell proliferation by facil- itating Rb phosphorylation and inactivation. Indeed, cyclin D is overexpressed in many tumors because of gene ampli- fication or translocation. Mutational inactivation of CDKIs also would drive the cell cycle by unregulated activation of cyclins and CDKs. As mentioned earlier, the CDKN2A gene is an extremely common target of deletion or muta- tional inactivation in human tumors. The emerging paradigm is that loss of normal cell cycle control is central to malignant transformation and that at least one of the four key regulators of the cell cycle (CDKN2A, cyclin D, CDK4, Rb) is mutated in most human cancers. Fuhermore, the transforming proteins of several oncogenic human DNA viruses act, in pa, by neutralizing the growth inhibi- tory activities of Rb. For example, the human papillomavi- rus (HPV) E7 protein binds to the hypophosphorylated form of Rb, preventing it from inhibiting the E2F transcrip- tion factors. Thus, Rb is functionally deleted, leading to uncontrolled growth",general_faq

Additional symptoms which may be reported in common with other forms of cholestasis are right upper quadrant pain, pale stools and dark urine.Changes in liver function in obstetric cholestasisThe most common abnormalities in liver function are:Increase in ALT (seen in 100% cases)Increase in AST (seen in 99% cases)Increase in bile acids (seen in 92%) cases)Elevated bilirubin (22%) of cases)Increased GGT (39% cases)Elevations in alkaline phosphatase are seen in cholestatic disease such as obstetric cholestasis as it is released from the damaged liver but because the enzyme is also released from the placenta in normal pregnancies, measurements are less helpful than outside the pregnancy.Serum bile acid test is the most accurate determinant of cholestasis of pregnancy.The problem with the bile acid test is that only a small number of labs around the world have the equipment necessary to perform it which can result in a considerable delay for women experiencing symptoms of the conditions.Liver biopsy in a case of obstetric cholestasis: -Liver biopsy demonstrates: -Acinar cholestasis with centrilobular bile staining and bile plugs in the canaliculi.Liver biopsy is the definitive diagnostic test of the disease.Postnatal course in obstetric cholestasisBiochemical abnormalities and pruritics in obsteric cholestasis persists until delivery following which resolution occurs.Pruritus is typically absent within 48 hour after delivery usually improved within 1 week.Liver function tests becomes normal within 6 weeks.Complications of obstetric cholestasisMeconium stained liquorPremature deliveryFetal distressPost-partum hemorrhageTreatment of obstetric cholestasis: -AntihistaminesChlorpheniramine can provide symptomatic relief in pruritus.Topical treatmentsIf the skin is well moisturized pruritus may be relieved.Ursodeoxycholic acidS-Adenosyl methionineDexamethasoneDexamethasone in high dose results in resolution of all pruritus cases and significant reduction in total bile acids and ALT.Vitamin KIn obstetric cholestasis there is malabsorption and subsequent deficiency of vitamin K.

This is a sex-linked recessive disorder presenting with the triad of thrombocytopenia, eczema, and recurrent sinopulmonary infections. Serum IgM levels are low but IgG, IgA, and IgE levels are increased. Patients have a defective response to polysaccharide antigens, which is due to a cytoskeletal defect in T cells that inhibits their binding to B cells.

Late diagnosis and care is associated with 4-fold increase in obstetric morbidity and 9-fold increase in preterm labor.* Poor nutritional states, hypoproteinemia, anemia and associated medical conditions add to maternal morbidity and mortality.* True congenital TB is believed to be rare. A fetus can get TB infection either by hematogenous spread through umbilical vein or by ingestion or aspiration of infected amniotic fluid. The risk to neonate of getting TB infection shortly after birth is greater.* ATT should be started as soon as possible, as untreated disease is a hazard to the mother and fetus.* The regimens recommended for use in pregnancy are same as for the nonpregnant state except for withholding of streptomycin. Currently, an intermittent regimen (thrice weekly on alternate days) under the DOTS strategyof RNTCP is being increasingly used worldwide for pregnant women having TB.* None of the AKT drugs are teratogenic and AKT should be started as soon as the diagnosis is made.

Gene associated with autosomal dominant breast cancer?,,"Ans. B. BRCA 1. (Ref.

The gene frequency in the population is approximately 0.0006. It does, however, occur with greater frequency in certain populations such as Ashkenazi Jews, in whom there is often a common (founder) mutation. BRCA2 .is located on chromosome 13q and there is an association with male breast cancer. Women who are thought to be gene carri- ers may be offered breast screening (and ovarian screening in the case of BRCA1, which is known to impart a 50 % lifetime risk of ovarian cancer), usually as part of a research programme, or genetic counselling and mutation analysis. Those who prove to be 'gene positive' have a 50-80 % risk of developing breast cancer, predominantly while premenopausal.

It is a novel thrombolytic based on snake venom derived protein. It is a direct fibrinolytic. It is not a plasminogen activator. It is neutralized by alpha-macroglobulin.PHARMACOLOGICAL REPERFUSION# Therapeutic plasminogen activators include streptokinase, urokinase, tPA and non-tPA fibrinolytics like Recombinant prourokinase, staphylokinase, and alfimeprase.- They are fashioned after endogenous tPA or urokinase that convert plasminogen into active plasmin. Plasmin degrades fibrinogen and fibrin in to FDPs.- tPA is released from endothelial cells, enters the fibrin clot, and activates plasminogen to plasmin.- Any free plasmin is complexed with a,plasmin inhibitor (a2PI).- Fibrin is degraded to low-molecular-weight fragments, fibrin degradation products (FDPs).# Innovative intravenous pharmacological reperfusion strategies include:- Novel fibrinolytic agents (tenecteplase, reteplase, desmetolplase, plasmin, and microplasmin),- GP Ilb/IIIa antagonists = platelet disaggregating effects (abciximab and tirofiban),- Combination therapies to improve efficacy of clot lysis (fibrinolytics and GP IIb/IIIa agents, and fibrinolytics and direct thrombin inhibitors), increase the time window for clot lysis (fibrinolytics and neuroprotectants), and reduce the frequency of hemorrhagic complications.",general_faq

"Drug of choice for sedation of a patient in ICU is: September 2009, March 2013 (a)",,"Ans. C: Propofol Benzodiazepines, e.g. diazepam, lorazepam and midazolam, are widely used as sedative agents in the ICU. Diazepam use has become less common as newer shoer-acting benzodiazepines have become available. Lorazepam is more potent than midazolam and, because of its low lipid solubility, crosses the blood-brain barrier more slowly, delaying its onset of action and prolonging the sedative effect. Hence, it is recommended for longer-term sedation while midazolam is preferred for sho-term sedation Propofol, another frequently used sedative agent, resembles midazolam in terms of pharmacological profile. Midazolam and propofol have similar efficacy and safety in sedating various groups of critically ill patients. Midazolam is, however, cheaper than propofol Neveheless, propofol, when used as a sedative in mechanically ventilated patients, is associated with shoer weaning times and hence, while midazolam may be cheaper, the overall cost-benefit analysis taking into account duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay may in fact be better with propofol.",medicine_info
Decreased number of melanocytes are seen in: March 2005,,"Ans. D: All of the above Melanopenic hypopigmentation is due to decrease in number of melanosomes, which could be due to: Genetic diseases-albinism, piebaldism A utoimmune diseases-vitiligo Post-inflammatory-Discoid lupus erythematosus Piebaldism is due to an absence of melanocytes in affected skin and hair follicles. The condition is present at bih and usually remains unchanged throughout life. This is caused by mutations of the KIT proto-oncogene. 14 point mutations, 9 deletions, 2 nucleotide splice mutations, and 3 inseions of the KIT gene are believed to be mutations causing piebaldism. The severity of the condition correlates with the site of the mutation within the KIT gene. Piebaldism is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder meaning half of an affected person's children will also have the condition. Piebaldism is one of the cutaneous signs of Waardenburg syndrome. Piebaldism is a rare inherited condition characterised by: White forelock in 80-90% of those affected (poliosis) White patch (due to absence of pigmentation) of the central poion of the forehead Eyebrow and eyelash hair may also be affected, either continuously or discontinuously with the forelock White patches of skin may also be seen on the face (paicularly the chin), trunk and extremities (hands and feet are not usually affected) Often a narrow border of hyperpigmented skin surrounds the white unpigmented patches Sometimes islands of normal or hyperpigmented skin occur within the white patches. Albinism is a condition in which people have little or no melanin pigment (compound that creates colour) in their eyes, skin or hair. Because of this people with albinism look a little different from other members of their family without albinism. They have very fair skin which is prone to sunburn, their hair is white or a very light colour, and they may squint a lot as their eyes are sensitive to sunlight.",general_faq

Natural killer cells,,"Natural Killer CellsThe function of NK cells is to destroy irreversibly stressed and abnormal cells, such as virus-infected cells and tumor cells. NK cells make up approximately 5% to 10% of peripheral blood lymphocytes.

The syndrome is characterized by severe hyperglycemia, a marked increase in serum osmolality and dehydration without accumulation of beta-hydroxybutyric or acetoacetic ketoacids. Significant ketogenesis is restrained by the ability of the pancreas to secrete small amount of insulin. Prolonged phase of osmotic diuresis leads to severe depletion of body water, which exceeds that of sodium, resulting in hypeonic dehydration.

A lesion in this nerve would cause deviation of the tongue toward the injured side, which could be observed upon protrusion of the tongue. The genioglossus is the major muscle involved in protrusion of the tongue. The genioglossus muscles arise from the inside of the mandible and pass posteriorly to insert into the deep aspect of the tongue. When the genioglossi contract, they pull the tongue forward, and out of the mouth, in protrusion. If one genioglossus is paralyzed, it acts like a brake on one side of the tongue when the tongue is pulled forward, causing the tip of the tongue to point to the nonmoving side.

HPV vaccine is ?,,"Both bivalent and Quadrivalent Currently, there are two types of cervical cancer vaccines available Gardasil vaccine (quadrivalent vaccine) Cervavarix vaccine (Bivalent vaccine) Gardasil vaccine Gardasil is a quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine. Gardasil is the only vaccine that helps protect against 4 types - types 6, 11, 16, 18 - of HPV. - The vaccine helps prevent diseases such as cervical cancer, abnormal and precancerous cervical lesions, vaginal lesions, vulvar lesions, and genital was, caused by these strains of HPV. Gardasil contains recombinant virus like paicle (VLPs) assembled from the Ll proteins of HPVs 6, 11, 16 and 18. - Since VLPs lack the viral DNA, they cannot induce cancer. They do, however, trigger an antibody response that protects vaccine recipients from becoming infected with the HPV Ives represented in the vaccine. Gardasil is recommended to be given to females aged between 9 to 26 years Gardasil provides 98% protection against cervical pre-cancers caused by HPV types 16 & 18, which are responsible for 70% of all cervical cancer cases worldwide. Similarly, in large placebo controlled, double blind, randomized, multicentric studies, the vaccine has also been proven to be 90% effective in the prevention of genital was caused by HPV types 6 and 11, which are responsible for 90% of all genital was cases worldwide. According to the Indian Academy of Pediatrics Committee of Immunization (L4PC01) 2008 recommendations : ""This vaccine has a .orable tolerability profile and the IAP-001 recommends offering HPV vaccine to all females as per label. The recommended age for initiation of vaccination is 10-12 years and catch up vaccination is permitted up to the age of 26 years. It is recommended to be given in three doses at 0, 2 and 6 months"". Gardasil is usually given in the arm muscle. Three shots are given on the following schedule: - Dose 1 -? - Dose 2 --4 2 months after Dose 1 - Dose 3 -4 6 months after Dose 1 Cervarix Cervarix is a vaccine against HPV types 16 and 18, which currently cause about 70% of cervical cancer cases. - Cervarix is a preventative cervical cancer vaccine, not therapeutic; Cervarix vaccine will not block infection .from cervical cancer-causing HPV strains other than HPV 16, 18, 31 and 45. Cervarix is using the ""L1 protein"" of the viral capsid. The viral proteins induce the .fonnation of neutralizing antibodies. The vaccine contains no live virus and no DNA, so it cannot infect the patient. Cervari data from patients show that at 18 months after the first of a three-dose regimen, 100 percent of women up to age 55 vaccinated with cervarix vaccine had antibodies present against the two most common cancer-causing human papillomavirus types, 16 and 18. Cervarix Vs. Gardasil: which is the better cervical cancer vaccine ? Cervarix is ""bivalent"" -effective against only two strains of the virus-vaccine. While Gardasil is ""quadrivalent"" vaccine (effective against four common strains of HPV). The question now arises which vaccine to be the vaccine of choice?? On the face of it a quadrivalent vaccine seems to be the better choice. In reality that is not so - The vaccine protects against the HPV viruses 16, 18, 6, 11, of which only the .first two are responsible for cervical cancer, while the other two are responsible for genital was. On the other hand cervarix gives protection against 16 and 18. It is better because, there is cross-reactive protection against the virus strains 45 and 31, two other viruses causing cervical cancer. Cervarix is formulated with ASO4, a propriety adjuvant that boosts the immune system response .for a longer period of time. Both vaccines are against the human papillom virus but cervarix seems to be more effective against cancer cervix. Cervarix can be given to females between 10 to 45 yrs old whereas Gardasil can be given to females between 10 to 26 yrs only. Both the vaccines are given in the schedule of 0, 1, 6 months, Cervarix is the costlier one being priced at Rs.3200 per dose.

What is a percentage of endothelial cell loss during Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty –,,"Endothelial cell loss is a known phenomenon of endothelial keratoplasty (including DSAEK).
I am not sure about the answer as various studies have given different values at a different time (post-operatively).
First read following statements which are supporting my answer:-

""Current modifications of EK such as DSAEK have shown a significantly higher cell loss at just 6-12 months after DSAEK surgery"".

–Corneal endothelial transplant

""Reports of endothelial cell loss have been very variable from as high as 50% at 6 months to 26% after 2 years in the Busin series. Other reports suggest that there is no difference between cell loss with a 40% loss at 1 year for both PLK and PK and a recent study comparing endothelial cell loss in historic PK Vs DSAEK or other PLK techniques showed no measurable difference"".

–Cornea & External eye disease

""The 12-month cell loss for 2 diagnoses (Pseudophakic/aphakic corneal edema and Fush's dystrophy) was comparable, i.e. 41% and 37%.

–Internet

""One-year endothelial cell loss after DSAEK is 15 - 40% (average 27%)"".

—XXIV Annual Meeting European Eye Bank Association

""There have been several publications showing endothelial cell loss to be in the range of 24-50% at 12-24 months post DSAEK"". 

Now read the statements, which have different values at different post-operative period:

""The 1, 3, and 5-year endothelial cell losses derived from the models after DSAEK were 56%, 66%, and 73%, respectively and after THPK were 24%, 50% and 64% respectively"". 
""The 5-year endothelial cell loss after DSEK compared favourably with that measured after penetrating Keratoplasty in the cornea donor study (53% Vs 70%)"".
""At 1-year post DSAEK, Bahar et al. published 36% cell loss, Busin et al. reported 24% cell loss; Covert and Koening published 57% and Gorovoy et al. 40%. At 2 years, the rate of endothelial cell loss is between 41% (Price & Price) and 36% (Terry et al).

Epigenetic deals with genetic modifications that do not alter the sequence of DNA. All of the following can detect epigenetic modification except:,,"Ans. a. HPLC (Ref: Robbins 9/e p180, 319-320 8/e p180-181)Methylation specific PCR, Bisulphite method and ChlP on Chip can detect epigenetic modification but not the HPLC.'Epigenetics is defined as the study of heritable chemical modification of DNA or chromatin that does not alter the DNA sequence itself Examples of such modification include the methylation of DNA, and the methylation and acetylation of histones. Since traditional Sanger sequencing alone cannot detect DNA methylation; other techniques have been developed to uncover these chemical modifications. One common approach is to treat genomic DNA with sodium bisulfite, a chemical that converts unmethylated cytosines to uracil, white methylated cytosines are protected from modification. An assay termed methylation-specific PCR uses two PCR primer sets to analyze single DNA loci: one to detect a DNA sequence with unmethylated cytosines (which are converted to uracils after bisulfite treatment) and the other to detect DNA sequences with methylated cytosines (which remain cytosines after bisulfite treatment).Additional techniques are evolving that provide a genome-wide snapshot of epigenetically altered DNA. These techniques are based on the ability to detect histone modifications such as methylation and acetylation (which, like DNA methylation, are important regulators of gene expression) by using antibodies against specifically modified histones. Such antibodies can be used to pull down bound DNA sequences, a method termed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). These pulled- down sequences can be amplified and analyzed by hybridizing to microarrays ('ChIP on Chip') or sequencing ('ChIP- Seq') to map epigenetically modified genes throughout the genome. - Robbins 8/e p180 Isolation of cells of the immune response* Use the correct number of cells: 1 x 106 x to 10 x 106* Collect biological replicates of cells* Choose an appropriate control for antibody specificity (knockout or RNAi knockdown)Fragmentation by sonication or MNase treatment* Shear chromatin to a size range of ~ 150-300 bp* Sonicate chromatin extracts for non-histone proteinsSonication conditions should be determined empirically for each cell typeTreat chromatin extracts with MNase for analysis of histone modificationsDo not overdigest chromatinChIP analysis of histone modifications, transcription factors or epigenetic regulators* Select antibody: monoclonal versus polyclonal* Choose reference control (Input or IgG)* Perform ChIP with established protocols* Purify DNALibrary construction* Do end repair and adapter ligation* Perform PCR using primers compatible with sequencing platformAvoid overamplifying DNA Sequencing* Determine sequencing depth on the basis of the prevalence of binding throughout the genome: more sequencing tags may be needed for diffuse signals (such as H3K27me3)* Perform single-end or paired-end sequencingEpigenetic AlterationsEpigenetics is defined as the study of heritable chemical modification of DNA or chromatin that does not alter the DNA sequence itself.Examples of such modification include the methylation of DNA. and the methylation and acetylation of histonesQ.Since traditional Sanger sequencing alone cannot detect DNA methylation, other techniques have been developed to uncover these chemical modifications.One common approach is to treat genomic DNA with sodium bisulfite, a chemical that converts unmethylated cytosines to uracil, while methylated cytosines are protected from modificationQ.An assay termed methylation-specific PCR uses two PCR primer sets to analyze single DNA loci: one to detect a DNA sequence with unmethylated cytosines (which are converted to uracils after bisulfite treatment) and the other to detect DNA sequences with methylated cytosinesQ (which remain cytosines after bisulfite treatment).Additional techniques are evolving that provide a genome-wide snapshot of epigenetically altered DNA.These techniques are based on the ability to detect histone modifications such as methylation and acetylation (which, like DNA methylation, are important regulators of gene expression) by using antibodies against specifically modified histones.

During angiogenesis recruitment of pericytes and peri-endothelial cells is due to -,,"Angiogenesis
o Blood vessels formation in adults is known as angiogenesis or neovascularization. It can occur by two ways:-
1. Angiogenesis from pre-existing blood vessels
The major steps in this process are
i. Vasodilatation by NO, and VEGF-induced increased permeability of the pre-existing vessel.
ii. Proteolytic degradation of the basement membrane by metalloproteinases (MMPs) and disruption of cell-to-cell contact between endothelial cells by plasminogen activator.
iii. Migration of endothelial cells towards angiogenic stimulus.
iv. Proliferation of endothelial cells, just behind the leading front of migrating cells.
v. Maturation of endothelial cells.
vi. Recruitment of periendothelial cells (pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells) to form the mature cells.
2. Angiogenesis from endothelial precursor cells (EPCs)
EPCs can be recruited from the bone marrow into tissues to initiate angiogenesis. Growth factors involved in the process of angiogenesis
o VEGF is the most important growth factor in adult tissues undergoing angiogenesis.
o The most important receptor for VEGF is VEGFR-2, a tyrosine kinase receptor.
o VEGF induces the migration of EPCs in the bone marrow, and enhances the proliferation and differentiation of these cells at sites of angiogenesis.
o FGF 2 can also stimulate endothelial cell proliferation, differentiation and migration.
o Newly formed vessels are fragile and need to become stabilized, which requires the recruitment
of pericytes and smooth muscle cells (peri-endothelial cells). Angiopoietin 1 and 2 (Ang 1 & 2), PDGF and TGF-fl participate in stabilization process.

Drug of choice for preventing Fetal Toxoplasmosis infection during pregnancy is -,,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Spiramycin * Classic congenital toxoplasmosis is characterized by the tetrad described by Sabin in 1942: chorioretinitis, hydrocephalus, intracranial calcification and convulsion.Signs such as intracranial calcification, microcephaly, hydrocephalus, and severe intrauterine growth restriction strongly suggest in utero infection in the presence of documented maternal infection.* Maternal-fetal transmission occurs between 1 and 4 months following placental colonization by tachyzoites* There are 2 goals of drug therapy for toxoplasmosis, depending on whether or not fetal infection has occurred. If maternal infection has occurred but the fetus is not infected, Spiramycin is used for fetal prophylaxis (to prevent spread of organisms across the placenta from mother to fetus). Spiramycin is a macrolide antibiotic that is concentrated in but does not readily cross the placenta, and therefore is not reliable for treatment of fetal infection. Use is aimed at preventing vertical transmission of the parasite to the fetus, and it is indicated only before fetal infection* It is given at a dose of 1 g (3 million U) orally every 8 hours.lt will be prescribed for the duration of the pregnancy if the amniotic fluid polymerase chain reaction is reported negative for T. gondii.* If fetal infection has been confirmed or is highly suspected, pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine are used for treatment. Pyrimethamine is a folic acid antagonist that acts synergistically with sulfonamides. This drug should not be used in the first trimester because it is potentially teratogenic. It produces a reversible, dose related depression of the bone marrow and therefore must be combined with folinic acid. The combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine results in a significant decrease in disease severity.",medicine_info
SIADH true is all except -,,"Water retention also occurs in the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH (SIADH). In this condition, an endogenous source of ADH (either cerebral or tumour-derived) promotes water retention by the kidney in the absence of an appropriate physiological stimulus (Box 16.13). The clinical diagnosis requires the patient to be euvolaemic, with no evidence of cardiac, renal or hepatic disease potentially associated with hyponatraemia. Other non-osmotic stimuli that cause release of ADH (pain, stress, nausea) should also be excluded. Suppoive laboratory findings are shown in Box 16.13. In this situation, plasma concentrations of sodium, chloride, urea and uric acid are low with a correspondingly reduced osmolality. Urine osmolality, which should physiologically be maximally dilute (approximately 50 mmol/kg) in the face of low plasma osmolality, is higher than at least 100 mmol/kg and indeed is typically higher than the plasma osmolality. The urine sodium concentration is typically high (> 30 mmol/L), consistent with euvolaemia and lack of compensatory factors promoting sodium retention. Plasma and urine electrolytes and osmolality (Box 16.14) are usually the only tests required to classify the hyponatraemia. Doubt about clinical signs of ECF volume may be resolved with measurement of plasma renin activity. Measurement of ADH is not generally helpful in distinguishing between these categories of hyponatraemia. This is because ADH is activated both in hypovolaemic states and in most chronic hypervolaemic states, as the impaired circulation in those disorders activates ADH release through non-osmotic mechanisms. Indeed, these disorders may have higher circulating ADH levels than patients with SIADH. The only disorders listed in Box 16.12 in which ADH is suppressed are primary polydipsia and iatrogenic water intoxication, where the hypo-osmolar state inhibits ADH release from the pituitary. The treatment of hyponatraemia is critically dependent on its rate of development, severity and underlying cause. If hyponatraemia has developed rapidly (over hours to days), and there are signs of cerebral oedema such as obtundation or convulsions, sodium levels should be restored to normal rapidly by infusion of hypeonic (3%) sodium chloride. A common approach is to give an initial bolus of 100 mL, which may be repeated once or twice over the initial hours of observation, depending on the neurological response and rise in plasma sodium. On the other hand, rapid correction of hyponatraemia that has developed slowly (over weeks to months) can be hazardous, since brain cells adapt to slowly developing hypo-osmolality by reducing the intracellular osmolality, thus maintaining normal cell volume.

"The cardiac silhouette can have an ""egg on side"" appearance in",,"Transposition of great vessels (TGA) is defined as aoa arising from the right ventricle and pulmonary aery from the left ventricle. In patients with TGA, the oxygenated pulmonary venous blood recirculates in the lungs whereas the systemic venous blood recirculates in the systemic circulation. The pulmonary aery saturation is thus always higher than the aoic saturation. Survival depends on the mixing available between the two circulations. Patients of complete TGA with intact ventricular septum are cyanotic at bih. Since the interatrial communication results in poor mixing, the neonates present with rapid breathing and congestive failure secondary to hypoxemia within the first week of life. Physical examination shows severe cyanosis, congestive failure, normal first sound, single second sound and an insignificant grade one to two ejection systolic murmur. The electrocardiogram shows right axis detion and right ventricular hyperophy. The thoracic roentgenogram shows cardiomegaly with a narrow base and plethoric lung fields. The cardiac silhouette can have an ""egg on side"" appearance: The right upper lung fields appear more plethoric than other areas. The thymic shadow is often absent. Patients of TGA with VSD have increased pulmonary blood flow; mixing at the ventricular level determines the severity of cyanosis. They develop congestive failure around 4-10 weeks of age. Physical findings consist of cyanosis, cardiomegaly, congestive failure, normal first sound, single or normally split second sound and grade II-IV ejection systolic murmur. Apical third sound gallop or a mid-diastolic rumble may be present. Electrocardiogram shows right axis detion with biventricular, right ventricular or left ventricular hyperophy. Chest X-ray shows cardiomegaly, plethoric lung fields and features of pulmonary venous hypeension. The aerial switch operation is now established as the treatment of choice for TGA, Prostaglandin El can help reduce cyanosis in selected cases by keeping the PDA open.

Gene duplication plays an impoant role in the evolution of aEUR',,"mRNA (most likely) Gene duplications are impoant forces of genome evolution which change genome size and lead to the evolution of new gene functions. Gene duplication (or chromosomal duplication or gene amplification) is any duplication of a region of DNA that contains a gene; it may occur as an error inhomologous recombination, a retrotransposition event, or duplication of an entire chromosome. The second copy of the gene is often free from selective pressure-- that is, mutations of it have no deleterious effects to its host organism. Thus it accumulates mutations faster than a functional single-copy gene, over generations of organisms. This freedom from consequences allows for the mutation of novel genes that could potentially increase the fitness of the organism or code for a new function. The two genes that exist after a gene duplication event are called paralogs and usually code for proteins with a similar function and/or structure. By contrast, ohologous genes are ones which code for proteins with similar functions but exist in different species",general_faq

Both have very similar range of activity, but colistin is more potent on Pseudomonas, Salmonella and Shigella. Mechanism of action They are rapidly acting bactericidal agents; have a detergent-like action on the cell membrane. They have high affinity for phospholipids: the peptide molecules (or their aggregates) orient between the phospholipid and protein films in gram-negative bacterial cell membrane causing membrane distoion or pseudopore formation. As a result ions, amino acids, etc. leak out. Sensitive bacteria take up more of the antibiotic. They may also inactivate the bacterial endotoxin.

Material used in verterbroplasty is :,,"Ans. is 'd' i.e. Polymethyl methacrylate Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are interventional radiologic procedures for the treatment of the intense pain refractory to medical management or bracing caused by vertebral compression fracture associated with osteoporosis, tumors, and trauma.Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty involve intraosseous injection of acrylic cement- polymethyl methacrylate under local anesthesia and fluoroscopic guidance.Pain reduction or elimination is immediate, and the risk of complications is low. Neither vertebroplasty nor kyphoplasty are intended for the treatment of intervertebral disc disease or arthritis.Vertebroplasty may also be applied prophylactically to an at-risk vertebra between 2 other abnormal vertebrae.Vertebroplasty does not restore the height of the compressed vertebral body. A related procedure, kyphoplasty, is intended to restore lost height by inflating a balloon pump within and between the fracture fragments prior to the infusion of the cement.

In contrast, in individuals with low viral replication, who are HBsAg- and anti-HBe-positive, viral loads are less than 105 copies/mL. The exception is in patients who have a mutation in the pre-core protein, which means they cannot secrete e antigen into serum . Such individuals will be anti-HBe-positive but have a high viral load and often evidence of chronic hepatitis. These mutations are common in the Far East, and those patients affected are classified as having e antigen-negative chronic hepatitis. They respond differently to antiviral drugs from those with classical e antigen-positive chronic hepatitis. Measurement of viral load is impoant in monitoring antiviral therapy and identifying patients with pre-core mutants. Specific HBV genotypes (A-H) can also be identified using PCR.

Acceptability – The test should be acceptable to population to which it is going to be applied.
Repeatability  (reliability, precision, reproducibility)  –  The test must give consistent results when repeated more than once on the same individual or material under the same condition.
Validity (accuracy) – It refers to what extent the test accurately measures which it purports to measure. (it means it expresses the ability of a test to separate or distinguish those who have the disease from those who do not). Accuracy refers to closeness with which measured values agree with “true” value.

It has two components:
i. Sensitivity – Ability of test of identify correctly all those who have disease.
ii. Specificity – Ability to test to identify correctly all those who do not have disease. 
So, if test gives the same reading for a sample on repeated testing means test is precise (i.e., reliable, reproducible, repeatable).",nutrition_advice

For men with a PSA above 4, PSA velocity of more than .75 ng/ml year is suggestive of Ca. While for those with lower PSA levels, rates above 0.5 ng/mL per year should be used to advise biopsy.* PSA density is calculated by dividing the serum PSA by the estimated prostate weight (measured by TRUS). It was developed to correct for the contribution of BPH to the total PSA level.# Values <0.10 are consistent with BPH.# >0.15 suggest cancer",general_faq

If the teeth were arranged on a smoothly curving line of occlusion and this molar relationship existed , then normal occlusion  would result. 
 
Angle then described three classes of malocclusion, based on the occlusal relationships of the first molars:

Class I: Normal relationship of the molars, but line of occlusion incorrect because of malposed teeth, rotations, or other causes.
Class II: Lower molar distally  positioned relative to upper molar, line of occlusion not specified.
Class III: Lower molar mesially positioned relative to upper molar, line of occlusion not specified.

Local anaesthetic injected directly into the tissue -,,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Infiltration anaesthesia Infiltration anaesthesiao It is the injection of local anaesthetic directly into tissue without taking into consideration the course of cutaneous nerve.o It can be so superficial as to include only the skin, it also can include deeper structureso It is used for minor surgeries, e.g. incision & drainage, suturing etc.o Adrenaline can be used along with LA to prolong its duration of action and to prevent its systemic absorptiono However adrenaline containing solution should not be used into tissues supplied by endarteries, e.g. in fingers and toes, ear, nose, and penis because vasoconstriction may lead to gangrene.Conduction blockA. Field blocko Is produced by subcutaneous injection of a solution of local anaesthetic in order to anaesthetize the region distal to the injection.o For example, subcutaneous infiltration of the proximal portion of the volar surface of the forearm results in extensive area of cutaneous anaesthesia that starts 2 to 3 cm distal to the site of injection.B. Nerve blocko LA is injected around a peripheral nerve or a plexus. Examples are -Upper limb - brachial plexus and wrist blockHead & Neck - Stellate ganglion block, trigeminal nerve block.Thorax & abdomen - Interc4ostal nerve & celiac plexuso Note - Most common complication of brachial plexus block is pneumothorax.",general_faq

Chemodectomas (Glomus Body Tumors) Dewta 7th/720-22# These are uncommon group of neoplasms that may originate anywhere glomus bodies are found.# The lesions are rare before the age of 20, there is a female predominance in some series, and the lesions may occur in multiple sites in about 10% to 20% of cases, especially in families with a history of this tumor.# These tumors usually occur later in life, around age 60 or 70, but can appear at any age. www.livestrong.com/glomus- jugulare-tumor# Carotid body tumors are associated with conditions producing chronic hypoxia, such as high-altitude habitation.# The normal glomus bodies in the head and neck vary from 0.1 to 0.5 mm in diameter. Tumors arising in glomus bodies {i.e., chemodectomas or nonchromaffin paragangliomas) arise most often from the carotid and temporal bone glomus bodies, with rare reports of tumors arising in the orbit, nasopharynx, larynx, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, tongue, and jaw.# The temporal bone glomus bodies are not found consistently in any location. At least one half of the glomus bodies are found in the general region of the jugular fossa and are located in the adventitia of the superior bulb of the internal jugular vein. The remainings are distributed along the course of the nerve of Jacobson (a branch of cranial nerve X).# The carotid bodies are located in relation to the bifurcation of the common carotid.Orbit bodies are in relation to the ciliary nerve, and vagal bodies are adjacent to the ganglion nodosum of the vagus nerve.Pathology# Chemodectomas are histologically benign tumors resembling the parent tissue and consist of nests of epithelioid cells within stroma-containing, thin-walled blood vessels and nonmyelinated nerve fibers. The tumor mass is well circumscribed, but a true capsule is not seen.# The criterion of malignancy is based on the clinical progress of the disease rather than the histologic picture. Chemodectomas without cellular atypia may metastasize to regional nodes or to distant organ sites.Patterns of SpreadThese lesions usually grow slowly; it is usual to have a history of symptoms fora few years and occasionally for 20 years or longer.LymphaticLymphatic metastases occur in about 5% of carotid body tumors but are very rare for temporal bone tumors. An upper neck mass may be an inferior extension of a jugular fossa or vagal tumor rather than a lymph node metastasis.Distant MetastasesDistant metastases have been rarely reported for temporal bone tumors; carotid body tumors have a low risk for distan t metastases, probably in the range of 5% or less.",general_faq

Surfactant appears in amniotic fluid at the gesta?tional age of :,,"Ans. is b i.e. 32 weeks Friends, I had to search a lot for this answer but all in vain. Only Nelson Paediatric throws some light on this issue : ""Pulmonary surfactant is a heterogenous mixture of phospholipids and proteins secreted into the saccular or alveolar sub-phase by the type ll pneumocytes. Its presence is first recognised in characteristic secretory organelles known as lamellar bodies as early as the 24th week of gestation. However, surfactant lipids of which the most abundant is phosphatidyicholine, are not detectable in the amniotic fluid until the 30th week of gestation, suggesting that there is a chronologic gap between surfactant synthesis and secretion. Labour probably shoens this gap because phospholipids are consistently found in the air spaces of infants born before the 30th week of gestation."" From the above lines it is clear : Surfactant synthesis occurs in 24th week of gestation, it appear in amniotic fluid in 30th week of gestation. Since 30 weeks is not given in options, I would personally go with 32 weeks, when surfactant will absolutely be detected in amniotic fluid, whereas at 28 weeks it can detected only if preterm labour occurs.",general_faq

The fluidity of the plasma membrane is increased by,,"Cholesterol maintains the fluidity of the membrane. Cholesterol acts as a buffer to modify the fluidity of membranes. A lipid bilayer made up of only one type of phospholipid changes from a liquid state to a rigid crystalline state (gel state) at a characteristic freezing point. This change in state is known as a phase transition, and the temperature at which it occurs is called the phase transition temperature (Tm). The Tm is higher (fluidity is low) when the constituent fatty acid chains are long and mostly saturated (without double bonds). Long chains have greater interactions among themselves, making the membrane stiffer. Saturated fatty acids have straight tails, whereas unsaturated fatty acids have kinked tails. As more kinks are inseed in the tails, the membrane becomes less tightly packed, and therefore its fluidity increases. .",general_faq

A ganglion is a small cyst located near a joint capsule or tendon sheath. A common location is around the joints of the wrist where it appears as a firm, fluctuant, pea-sized, translucent nodule. It arises as a result of cystic or myxoid degeneration of connective tissue; hence the cyst wall lacks a true cell lining. The fluid in the cyst is similar to the synovial fluid; However, there is no communication with the joint space.",general_faq

Action potential is produce by,,"(A) Sodium Influx # Action potential is due to opening of Na+ channels causing ""Na+ influx""> As the membrane potential is increased, sodium ion channels open, allowing the entry of sodium ions into the cell. This is followed by the opening of potassium ion channels that permit the exit of potassium ions from the cell.> Inward flow of sodium ions increases the concentration of positively-charged cations in the cell and causes depolarization, where the potential of the cell is higher than the cell's resting potential.> Sodium channels close at the peak of the action potential, while potassium continues to leave the cell.> Efflux of potassium ions decreases the membrane potential or hyperpolarizes the cell.> For small voltage increases from rest, the potassium current exceeds the sodium current and the voltage returns to its normal resting value, typically -70 mV.> However, if the voltage increases past a critical threshold, typically 15 mV higher than the resting value, the sodium current dominates.> This results in a runaway condition whereby the positive feedback from the sodium current activates even more sodium channels. Thus, the cell ""fires,"" producing an action potential",general_faq
